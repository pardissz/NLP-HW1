Mikaミカ,Luke skywalker fought an inter dimensional incarnation of chaos in the force yet someone cracking the ground with the force scares him like what 😂,0

Dean Esposito,"tbh this trailer was pretty fantastic, it has subtle hints of things in the movie and is incredibly well edited.",0
Jackson Sutarno,Gotta give a hand to the people who make the trailers cuz this is so misleading to the film they actually put out 😂,3
Mason Monroe,I was so hyped for this in the months leading up to it!!! It was disappointing to me but over the years I&#39;ve actually started to think it&#39;s the best of the sequels,0
DragonZaler,The movie that ended up being the second worst star wars movie ever. To me rise of skywalker is the worst movie ever.,1
gobogoo,best star wars movie in like 30 years,2
Николай,This movie is part of my childhood!,2
ROGUE THE OUTLANDER,Look at this<br><br><br>So much potenial<br><br><br><br><br>Such a change to be the darkest movie of the franchise<br><br><br><br><br>Big chance for lore during Ben&#39;s jedi years<br><br><br><br>But no<br><br>We got comedy and then episode 9 the rise of garbage,0

anthony,"5 years ago, star wars died WORST movie of all time and SW9 was even worse",2
Daniel C,"I really liked this one, it&#39;s a bummer it didn&#39;t work for a loud portion of the internet. Maybe Rise of Skywalker would&#39;ve been better if Disney didn&#39;t feel the need to do damage control.",2

George Daniels,Rey is a pathetic. The Dylan Mulvaney of characters.,1
Archie Taylor,"Tbh the Force Awakens doomed the sequels to be derivative and unoriginal, I can&#39;t really imagine this movie being good. That being said, I think they couldn&#39;t have gone in a better direction with it - a repeat of the Empire Strikes Back would have been so much worse.",1
Retro Studios,"man the hype leading up to this movie was insane. it was such a moment bro! this trailer, the theory’s, hell even the theater experience was epic. i’ll never forget it. yes this movie has its problems but i honestly will always defend it, it’s definitely still the best out of the sequel trilogy for sure.",63

Maxwell LaPlant,"I don’t care what people say, I’ve always loved this movie and I’ll never forget when I saw it in theaters",3
Zay Anything,At least Andor gave Andy Serkis another crack at giving us a memorable SW performance after how they did him dirty as Snoke.,2
Marc senses,Perfekt Trailer dumbest Film,0
Mark Deez,"Regardless how you feel about the final movie, this trailer is BY FAR the crowned jewel of all of the Star Wars sequels trailers. <br><br>No wonder they were so quick to announce a Rian Johnson trilogy. This trilogy is purely magic. <br><br>Also, say what you want about Disney Era SW, but Rian Johnson is the closest<br>we will ever get to George Lucas, in the sense that he is a master auteur filmmaker. <br><br>Me personally, I love The Last Jedi. It’s the only film in that entire trilogy that took bold risks. And like all SW, some worked, some failed miserably. But Rian is the only filmmaker that wrote, produced, and directed the entirety of his installment. Please give him a trilogy! <br><br>I would also love to see Rian get to direct some episodes for one of the Disney+ series. He, Ram Bergman, and Steve Yedlin are the Triple Threat we need.<br><br>Can’t wait for The Glass Onion. Knives Out was tremendous.",5
DatGreyStatueTho,"Didn&#39;t love it, didn&#39;t hate it, but it was enjoyable nonetheless...",5
Joshua Blackfyre,When I was younger I always thought star wars was dumb. But something told me to watch it so I watched all the star wars movies. I loved it even more when I found out a resistance was at play. I love movies about rebels/resistance and stuff,0
Renan Berto,"Well, Rian Johnson, the director said that the original one had a 3-hour cut, longer than 2-hour one, so we&#39;re 6 months away and I want the Lucasfilm Ltd. to officialy release the 3-hour cut to life, it could be better than the theatrical one, you know what I mean?",0
raphael ostrowski,When we thought this was going to be a good movie. Instead we got the worst movie in human history,3
Sci Fi Cinema,"Love or hate this movie, you cannot deny how well it was marketed. Quite possible the best Star Wars trailers were for this movie. Which just goes to show that the potential was there, but the execution was lacking",4
ChunkySaurus,Worst movie of all time,4
lukewhatidid,The fact that FIN never tried to sway any of the other kidnapped raised stormtroopers and just switched sides and started killing people he knew didn’t have a choice like him IS a huge character hole.,4
Morgan Evans,This movie was the best out of the 3 new ones ride of skywalker was absolute garbage,2

RedStrider2099,&quot;This is not going to go the way you think.&quot;<br><br>We should have known what we were in for: a bloated boring cynical insistence on the director&#39;s own self-importance.,0
Xobik1,"One of the best trailers for the worst star wars episode ever made...<br>They didn&#39;t follow Star Wars basic rules to second movie in a trilogy (Time jumps between episodes to give a sense of evolution, create empaty between the public and the protagonists, reveal a great secret, let the protagonist fail and be saved by their friends).",1
derezzeduser1138 d,Breathtaking visuals and cinematography is what can achieve when youre confident with your script have time to plan your shots and storyboard your freaking scenes ahead of time. That way you don&#39;t get mistakes like Leia not hugging Chewie or crappy dogfights against old star destroyers and tie fighters in Exegol.,2
The Magic Of,Incredible trailer for a movie that single hand-idly did more disrespect to the lore and franchise than any other film in history.,4
Lomes,So much potential... wasted,1
Ignis Dragon,Nice 👍,1
frank 55,Cool trailer but sometimes I want to pretend this movie and episode 9 never happened so the mystery of the force awakens could still be preserved,6

iván darío,"Damned this is probably the best star wars directed film, with an excelent concept. If it wasn´t for Rian Johnson as Screenwriter, JJ Abrams sequel that instead of fixing it make it worse and Kathleen Kennedy as a producer. The sequels could have been huge films, just missed a good screenwriter like the one of episode 7 to write the other two films.  Saddly it was badly written and it didn&#39;t had unity and coherence with episode 7 and 9. What a way to screwed a trilogy, a movie and two directors career, miss Kennedy.",0

Yes it wasnt perfect and the whole Finn/Rose side story was a waste of time, and Luke&#39;s character could have been handled better (although his ending was perfect), but it was so much better than the other 2 which were just fan service. It was original for star wars, and tried something new. I wish they&#39;d continued on this route for the next one rather than bowing to criticism from fans who want to see the same film that was released 40 years ago",4

The best what happend to this series was Ben, totally unobvious , complex, mesmerizing character ( IMHO he&#39;s way more interesting than Anakin even, sorry) . He and the chemistry between him and Rey ( and nooo, I am not talking about sexual tension :p) is something you just cannot ignore. Battle scenes are great, the general rough character movie and so on. I mean, thanks for that. Saying that I really hope that Ben will be back as Skywalkers in general deserved better ending❤️",4

Honestly if they let rian Johnson write their rise of skywalker, I have no doubt it would be divisive but at least half would’ve liked it, most people despised the rise of skywalker. Rian took the story in a completely different direction, and Abrams just didn’t have the writing skills to continue in that direction, so he tried to force the story back into his own intended route when it no longer fitted.",0

schnubbel76,"Coming back after Rise of Skywalker happened, I can appreciate the last Jedi so much more even more than i already did before. Rise of Skywalker left me so empty, so sad and disappointed. It is horrible. Last Jedi had so many good ideas and surprises. From a storytelling point of view the way better film. I see how hard it was to get back on track with a story that makes sense after all the &quot;rules&quot; that Rian Johnson broke. But i&#39;m sure, someone with more imagination than JJ Abrams could have done this. Maybe even George Lucas (if he only would write the script, but not the dialouge and do not the directing). Abrams knows how to set up a story. But he does not know how to end it.",1

Uaintevenvibin,"It would be a dream come true if middle aged men if not grown men would stop criticizing every part of the sequels, and prequels. I guess that’s the cool thing to do now “hate on the sequels.” I mean you so called “StarWars fans” almost drove one of the cast to suicide over a character the played. Not to mention you people complain about “how Disney ruined Star Wars” you guys ruined StarWars, George said himself he would’ve never sold StarWars to Disney if the prequels didn’t get as much backlash it got for no reason. I guess that’s what’s being a StarWars fan is now. Soon enough the StarWars fandom will become hated, but not by the movies but by us.",1

Thank goodness  The Rise Of Skywalker ended on a good note &amp; was considerably more entertaining.,0

Vincent Freeman,"What people didn&#39;t understand about this movie:<br>If everyone trusted &quot;purple hair&quot; and Leia, a lot less rebels would have died (sorry for my english). Without their plan they ALL would have died. If Poe, at the beginning of the movie, didn&#39;t try to be a hero trying to destroy the big spaceship a lot of people could be still alive (Rose&#39;s sister, for example). If Finn didn&#39;t try to infiltrate (failing miserably) the New Order would  have never discovered the rebels plan. It&#39;s the message of the entire movie: don&#39;t take part in the war, it doesn&#39;t matter what faction you fight for. We all lose if we fight each other. Two characters understood this in the movie: the thief (Benicio del Toro) and Rose. &quot;That&#39;s how we&#39;re gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.&quot;<br>We live in times where governments and everyone who has power want people to be split, to fight each other. They spread hate, they want us to be divided in factions. Light side, dark side...tells you nothing? Rey is the first to understand that both sides are worthy. It doesn&#39;t matter what we fight for, establishments will always take profit from our fight. The thief tells it pretty explicitly.",0

At the time there are no Episode 7, I always imagine that I want to see Luke rebuilding the Jedi Order and I hated that he failed in their opinion!!! They destroyed the series altogether. I&#39;m just a fan that&#39;s why I still watch it. Hoping that the ninth is good. Hoping they add ten to twelve and please, give us the rebuilding of the Republic and re-open the Jedi Order. Be political and complicated like the original six please!",0

But a movie never disappointed me more than episode 8. I couldn&#39;t believe it walking out of the theater, a bad Star Wars movie? I haven&#39;t watched it since, and maybe I should, but I don&#39;t want to. The movie felt slow IMO like they were wasting time, and once Luck threw the lightsaber back after first getting it, that was it for me. The way they butchered Luck Skywalker in this movie was unforgivable, and Rey practically carries the entire movie IMO. I just pray to God that Episode 9 won&#39;t be bad, but we&#39;ll have to see...",1

Jamie,Even this trailer sucks compared to TFA and the rise of skywalker. Idk why but it’s just boring. There’s no shots like Kylo’s lightsaber in the first one or Kyle and Rey fighting on the ship in the water in the new one. Everything about this middle installment is terrible. It’s like the anti Empire Strikes Back.,1
ejdjjx Stcfjdb,They should&#39;ve just turned this into a sequel to Spaceballs. That would&#39;ve been much more fitting and made a lot more sense. I can&#39;t believe they actually passed this off as an official star Wars movie.,4

No one would have used as much restraint in writing Luke Skywalker as he did, and, as a result, we got a perfect portrayal of the character, completely in line with the Original Trilogy. Hell, I’d say it’s TOO in line with the Luke we know and love, who, apparently, no one really knows all that well considering all the backlash towards his role in this movie.",1

James Emmerick,is not eluding to the explanations to many of the long running riddles...  far too many riddles... few who know see and can explain but refuse to... the riddles need answering for themselves for freedom to be loosed... the dark seeks to control and destroy it is all it knows and has the patience for... but the light is life hope future path that all comes together to build and create for life&#39;s sake... for if The Force can not live build increase expand... the force would collapse on itself and all existence will be crushed into a deep void of nothingness... where even the darkside can not live... for in this paradigm this star wars cosmology The Force broke and was split so the dark side developed so that the Force now has a shadow... therefore one can not be without the other... so teh riddle is... how in this cosmology can the &quot;sides&quot; be reconciled?...,0

Edwin Sanchez,This the sequel we deserved but not the one we needed,0
Robaidh Innes,"People keep saying that “Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars”. Are they forgetting that Star Wars has already been ruined by George Lucas with his abysmal prequel trilogy. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are both just complete cinematic abortions. Subpar to downright woeful acting, embarrassing cliche riddled script, underdeveloped characters, dull nonsensical boring plots, bad pacing of the story, no clear central character and absolutely hideous, dated CGI that comprises the majority of the films style. Revenge of the Sith has the most interesting story to tell but is still plagued with the same issues that haunt its two shambolic predecessors. The Last Jedi is not a good movie and I’m not defending it, but it isn’t any worse than Revenge of the Sith and in my opinion it’s a more bearable experience than the first two prequels. Hell, at least the actors actually had real locations and sets to work with rather than sterile rooms enveloped in blue screen where they are told what is going to be there. Best approach to Star Wars? Watch the original trilogy and then just pretend that everything thereafter didn’t happen.",0

I don&#39;t think Disney is ruining Star Wars, but the team they put in charge is.

Xanatos21,"As someone who grew up with the original, unaltered SW trilogy on VHS tape (and even enjoyed the Special Editions to an extent, excluding some ridiculous alterations like Greedo firing first and Vader screaming, &quot;Nooooo!&quot; in the Blu-ray release of Episode 6), I will admit that I found The Last Jedi to be pretty enjoyable, albeit imperfect, when I saw it for the first time on opening night. I felt it was very well done, but still incomplete in terms of Rey&#39;s story and some parts that just felt a bit out of place (to this day, I still think certain segments of Canto Bight stick out like a sore thumb). However, I must confess that with each new viewing, the film somehow gets better and better for me. My perception may be perceived as &quot;crazy&quot; to many longtime fans of the franchise (especially those who actually got to see the original, unaltered trilogy in cinemas during their official releases back in 1977, 1980, and 1983), but to me, Episode 8 is one of those films that deserves more than just one viewing. <br><br>Each time I have re-watched it, I always seem to notice something new that I missed from previous viewings. I have also come to appreciate the plot more and the Special Features available in the Blu-ray release (mainly the BTS footage and interviews with the cast and crew, including Director Rian Johnson) truly do add greater insight and helps it all make much more sense. In addition, many people (including myself, originally) seem to have forgotten that this is only the SECOND PART of a brand new trilogy. With that said, not every single revelation will be witnessed quite yet (for example, we still don&#39;t know how Maz found Luke&#39;s blue lightsaber, let alone exactly who the Knights of Ren are and what happened to them). <br><br>I do believe it is safe to say that Episode 9 will give the fans what they&#39;ve been eagerly anticipating in terms of answering every single unanswered question that Episodes 7 and 8 made us ponder over. With J.J. Abrams back in the directing chair, that is especially reassurance for those who loved Episode 7, but didn&#39;t care much for Episode 8. Nevertheless, I still consider the latter installment to be a film that requires multiple viewings (the BTS footage is also highly recommended if you wish to understand more to the backstory of Episode 8). For me, personally, it has been growing on me more and more with each time I re-watch it. As a longtime SW fan (who also enjoyed the prequels, despite some of the bad acting, atrocious dialogue, Jar-Jar Binks, and the cardboard love story between Anakin and Padme), I honestly think that Episode 8 deserves another chance. <br><br>Even if you&#39;ve already seen it and hated it, I&#39;d suggest watching it again (even if you have to turn the subtitles on in order to follow along better) and keeping a sharp eye out for certain things that you may not have noticed before. Many people were also extremely disappointed by The Empire Strikes back when it first hit cinemas back in 1980 (especially those who expected it to have that thrilling, swashbuckling-esque adventure theme contained in its predecessor, A New Hope, but instead got a sequel that was very dark and devastating in comparison), but I do believe that, with time, The Last Jedi will receive even more praise than it currently has.",8

He was a far more relatable character for his flaws, bad decisions and self-pitying bitterness. Characters in movies are not there to fulfill your emotional need for nostalgia but to allow for a suspenseful story to happen. There is too much shallow nostalgia in pop culture as it is. When Luke tossed the lightsaber away I knew this was going to be interesting.",22

Frederico Batista,"Excellent trailer, disappointment of a movie. Rian thought subverting the expectations was the right thing to do. He wanted to make his own movie not caring for the overall story past or beyond and left us with a bad taste on our mouth. He even only had 12 wipes in Last Jedi. C&#39;mon... But he had a chance to save his movie by having reshoots when Carrie Fisher died. He just had to save Luke for Episode 9 and all the backlash would eventually die down. Why send off Luke with such a mystic moment in the middle chapter? It&#39;s nuts and it&#39;s the real thing people are hurt about The Last Jedi.",2

I expected Sharknado to be a bad movie, but there are good bad movies.  The Last Jedi is a Star Wars movie and Star Wars is supposed to be great.  Star Wars movies DON&#39;T look at characters you&#39;ve known and loved for 30 years and make them turn their backs on their core characteristics. <br><br><br>As a child I wanted to be a Jedi, I wanted to be Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker saw good in the evilest man in the galaxy.  Too bad Luke just stands for trying to kill his nephew and drinking alien-testicle-breast-milk now.<br><br><br>The Force Awakens was not a perfect movie but it still had me excited for what came next. &quot;The Last Jedi will make The Force Awakens better,&quot; I told myself. What I tell myself now is: &quot;Star Wars sucks now, but hopefully Ep.9 can make it ok.&quot;  I have very little faith.<br><br><br>No one will ever read my comment but I pray Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy do. You two did what I thought nothing could ever do, you made me hate Star Wars. I expected this sequel trilogy to re-ignite my love for Star Wars so I could celebrate it with my kids. <b>You subverted that expectation.</b>",89

gibson chomar,"I loved this movie. I loved it way more than I did The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson did away with all the cliches Episode VII set up that everyone was expecting and showed us that not all fan theories are supposed to be true. Just because he did things in a way that you didn&#39;t expect him to, it doesn&#39;t mean that the movie was bad. Heck, even George Lucas praised this movie, and he&#39;s the guy who created Star Wars. He also praised Rogue One. The one movie he did not praise was Episode VII. What does that say about this movie? Star Wars &#39;fans&#39; need to understand that some things do not have to go the way they would have wanted it to go and can still be good. This movie reflects real life in many ways. Just like in real life, we all get that feeling that the world revolves around us (the feeling that Rey&#39;s parents were some high ranking people in the galaxy-most likely Luke and some big character that hasn&#39;t been revealed) only to find out that her parents were just drunkards that sold her off. The side quest that Finn and Rose went on that ended up failing is also under this phenomenon. Just because they went on a side quest, it doesn&#39;t have to end in success, and that doesn&#39;t make it irrelevant to the story either. It just shows that you can go on adventures, learn lessons and skills, but ultimately fail to achieve your overall objective. Not everything that takes place has to be a success. And for those who say &#39;why didn&#39;t the First Order use lightspeed to catch up to the rebels?&#39;, you seriously don&#39;t understand how lightspeed works. Lightspeed means travelling at 347000 kilometers per second. How would they be able to make that work exactly without damaging their ships by ramming into the Resistance ships and potentially killing important First Order personnel?",1

Kristof Croes,"Never understood how the haters always manage to to ignore the stellar professional reviews (no, disney didn&#39;t bribe about every professional critic out there. It&#39;s near impossible to fake a 91% RT and 85 MC score, because companies simply don&#39;t know who will review the movie to begin with and as one of the most popular franchises out there, TLJ raked in about 400 reviews counted on RT. There&#39;s simply no way to keep bribery on that scale under the wraps.) Not to mention, scientific polls of audience satisfaction have also been incredibly positive. Really the only thing that might indicate the majority hates it, is coming from the RT userscore (45%) and online comment sections, but those are biased samplings, usually only people with a very strong opinion go out of their way to comment/vote. Even on imdb it managed to get a user score of 7,2 based on 400k+ votes, which actually again indicates the majority of voters enjoyed it.<br><br>Conclusion; it&#39;s far more likely that TLJ is a pretty great movie that just upset a very vocal and somewhat sizable minority, as opposed to scientific polls and hundreds of professional film critics being wrong/bribed",23

This was an amazing movie. From the battles to seeing Luke battle evil one last time to the sacrifices the resistance made and to the war mongering evil that is the First Order. <br>They are all so awesome and just dammit! This movie is amazing. <br>I understand people’s disappointment to the result of luke and some unnecessary decisions that were made for this movie. <br>I truly from the bottom of my heart dismiss them.<br>I loved Rose she has a good heart in a dangerous galaxy. <br>I love Luke Skywalker, he showed me that even with all you can do and accomplish that you are still human and you can’t be the galant hero all your life. <br>I get it. <br>This is not how people wanted to see Luke portrayed as. <br>But just keep in mind that he has spent a good part of his life dedicating to Ben and ultimately failing him by accident.<br>You can’t stay good forever.<br>This was an amazing movie and I loved it.",1

I just REALLY wish I&#39;d stop getting attacked for not liking it.  How am I a racist (even though I&#39;m biracial), sexist bigot for not liking this movie??  I think that&#39;s the REAL reason for most of the fan backlash.  Most of us can deal with a bad movie.  I mean hell, the franchise survived Attack of the Clones (TLJ was worse though), but no one was getting attacked for liking or disliking the movie.  George Lucas didn&#39;t call anyone manbabies for the backlash that movie got.  But when you openly attack the fans, you get movies like Solo that lose over $100 Million instead of making a profit.

Osborn,I feel like this film would have been better if they didn’t go to that casino world.  Admiral Holdo should’ve told everyone the plan.,0
projectrooster,The original movie had an audience cause it was decent films with incredible sfx and basically something new and that grabbed audiences in the 70’s and 80’s but what has kept Star Wars alive is the universe and lore. What JJ and Johnson have failed to realize is that it is the lore that will make fans happy and see their movies 15times in 1 week. The originals had the power of something being ground breaking sfx wise and how space was viewed in films. You aren’t going to recapture that so stick to the lore! Force awakens was meh... but it introduced some interesting lore like the knights of ren and how maz got lukes saber and even who is snoke but The last Jedi did not for even for a second dig into this and what tlj introduced to the lore / universe contradicted 40years of established lore. The new trilogy has broken the universe thus it is no longer interesting. I was going to see solo but became disinterested after TLJ and I probably won’t see ep9. I usually bring several people to StarWars films who aren’t interested starwars so Disney will be losing around 5 ticket sales just from me. I really wished they had respected the original characters and universe. George Lucas was a crappy storyteller but genius universe builder.,1

There was such a sense of spite and hate in these reviews that it makes me wonder if the original Star Wars films have become sacred objects. In fact, Star Wars is almost like a religion: if you insult the sacred texts (or movies in this case), then you become the recipient of alot of hate. The reaction to this movie is the most interesting thing about this movie. In the case of Star Wars, the original 3 movies are so loved that I feel no new movie could ever recieve the same kind of praise ever again. Would anyone else say that the original star wars are sacred too?",0

ScotsBiochemistry,"Dear Disney,  I strongly think that Rian Johnson, the driector of The Last Jedi, doesn&#39;t understand the Star Wars world properly, that was given to us, between 1977 and 1983.  I have watched it enough.  I know what it is about.  I still insist that Fuel is not meant to run out in star wars, and it shoulnd&#39;t even be mentioned.  It is never mentioned in the original triology from 1977 to 1983 and it never runs out.  What blew out mind 38 years ago, was the fact that the Star Wars world, had tonnes of incredible technology, that was lightyears ahead of ours on Earth, and it never let them down and it never ran out of fuel.  So, while they battled against an evil repressive dictorial Empire, where sometimes they had victories, and other times they lost, the incredible technology they used, amazed us as an audience, and the characters were generally happy and optimistic about their challenges, because they used all the incredibly advanced technology, which they took for granted.  And the Jedi played a central role in defeating the Empire. But without the Jedi, they would have ultimately lost.  Sorry, I just don&#39;t think Mr Rian Johnson understands Star Wars properly.  Francis, Film director.",3
Hora do Play Gameplays,Hey! Look who&#39;s back. Another month passed and I came back here just to remeber that this movie &quot;spoiled&quot; the Saga.  I hope the money damage will be big for Disney to undestand what the public expects from the franchise. Tks again Rian Johnson!,2

One of the best trailers I’ve ever seen in my life I’ll give that to em, but it is also the biggest trap of a trailer I’ve ever seen in my life.",1232

Felipe Lugo,"I think that what has made the first Star Wars Trilogy so iconic (and special, of course) is the idea of something new.<br><br>Tha people who disliked Episode VIII mostly say that it throws to the trash can everything Star Wars did in the past, from the characters to the simple idea of the Force, even stuff from Episode VII where radically different in this film. But maybe this was the plan all along, create attention and let people realize that things can’t stay the same forever, people change and so does the fictional characters, the mythology and the new planets and alien races and even the people BTS.<br><br>I loved this film, a little more than VII and VI, but even if I agree with the criticisms of the movie, this was an exciting, fun, colorful, meaningful, tearful and brilliant stage for the larger universe this galaxy, far far away has been telling us for decades to come...",2

Also the characters were horribly underdeveloped yet the original characters we all know and love like Luke we’re ruined. Rey is a nobody and I have no attachment to any of the new characters. Disney is incredibly out of touch with their audience. Here’s a hint, if you’re gonna make a movie and slap the title Star Wars over it, make sure that movie appeals to the Star Wars fans! I don’t think anyone who is a fan of Star Wars thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This movie managed to erase the very essence of what Star Wars is",5

blitzwaffe,I thought it was decent. I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t go with the typical gamble everything you got against the worst odds possible and magically win. Most of the stuff was thought out or explained enough I think. The scenes with Rose could use improvement as they didn&#39;t quite tie in well enough with the main plot. However I&#39;ve seen people comment that Rose is worse than Jar Jar. NO That is and never will be true. Darth Jar Jar is still the worst.

𝔻𝕒𝕧𝕚𝕕 𝕊𝕞𝕚𝕥𝕙,Once upon a time there was a great space opera called Star Wars set in a futuristic world of the Middle Ages.<br>A knight saved the entire galaxy from the dark Empire and everyone lived happily ever after. <br>Then along came the feminist Kathleen Kennedy and Disney who destroyed the mythology created by George Lucas.,3
FK,"Disney are making each film as it goes and basing the next one on what the fans are saying it needs improving, they have no idea what they’re doing, honestly",93
THEMADCHESYHD REVIEWS,Star Wars fans need to start making up their minds… Like seriously! First you guys start complaining about how the force awakens was so much like a new Hope and now you guys are complaining because there were so many problems in this movie it was so different...COME ON! Rian Johnson (which is the guy who directed this movie) said that He wasn’t trying to change Star Wars he was just making a good Star Wars movie and I totally respect that and I’ll be honest I’ve seen this movie three times I still think this was a lot better in the force awakens now of course there were some problems in this movie but I didn’t make a big deal about it because I still enjoyed it... i’m not going to blame Disney for this movie I’m going to blame the fans Who hated this movie so much.,6
Josh LeBlanc,"A movie shouldn&#39;t cater to the audiences expectations. What you saw was someone else&#39;s take on the next installment, not your own. If a film followed the same road every time, it would be too familiar and predictable(like TFA which many people criticized too. What more do you want?). This movie took the franchise in a new direction and opened up the possibility for more stories to be told. with it&#39;s amazing set of characters.",13

Gorantaylis,"Film started poorly and was looking like a disappointment, but it pulled itself together towards the end with a good plot and exciting finale. Biggest issue with this film though was the fact Disney made it. Too much of a family film. The ridiculous things BB-8 did, the needless cuteness of the Porgs and the cliche quotes on love. It&#39;s all good, but it doesn&#39;t fit in Star Wars.",2
mickey starr,"the backlash against this movie is justified, if you wanna fill a movie with silly political correctness and SJW messaging, don&#39;t be surprised of the audience rating of 49% on RT (last I check), and heaps of youtube videos expressing what a crappy and bad movie it is, because of it.",3

Elliott Vest,"Watched this movie twice. First time I fell to the criticisms everyone had. There were obvious plot holes, the humor was toned a little higher then it should have, and the story felt just like a huge cluster that was struggling to tie together. I enjoyed it, though - basically I just recognized the obvious pros and cons that made up the movie...<br><br>However, during the second watching, I knew exactly what I was getting into. I was prepared for the bad moments, and I noticed that upon second viewing, half the moments I was dreading to see again didn’t really affect me the second time, and the sections of the movie I still disliked actually warmed up to me. <br>Furthermore, I was absolutely giddy the whole time waiting to rewatch the parts that I did enjoy the first time, and was floored at the fact that these scenes still held to their epicness on second viewing.<br><br>Rewatchability. That’s what this movie has. Most films made aren’t going to be rewatched - even if they are known to be fantastic films. But a Star Wars film needs this trait. In 10-15 years when I show my kids this franchise, you best believe I’m gonna still be giddy watching every movie.<br><br>P.S.   I rewatched Rogue One for the third time literally right after my second viewing of the Last Jedi and I had a significantly more fun time with the Last Jedi - just another interesting thing to note :).",26

deep mind,"The force is now a generic superpower that people can use easily. Generic or small character development and incredible character contradictions, plot holes that don&#39;t have a chance for any reasonable explanation, and females must be very strong from the start thus killing realistic character development. Ladies and gents, Disney has turned star wars into generic wars",0
thebobhollyband,"Theories that fell through, who cares? I never read them anyway, and change is good! But this movie and it&#39;s story was dull. Coming from a super giant like Disney, I would expect a little more magic. I like the new characters, but I don&#39;t think I will ever love them. Most died before I even had a chance to like them. And what happened with the original characters? After a very long wait, I think that we could all agree, they could have been used in a much better way. I would blame my lack of enthusiasm on my age, but that doesn&#39;t explain why my children cried themselves to sleep after watching it. In my opinion, this movie was a bland disgrace to Star Wars, but I did enjoy the 2 hour space chase part! I was tired and needed a nap.",1

After seeing it I have to agree...there is so much promise in this movie with brilliant set pieces but unfortunately it&#39;s all wasted with plot lines that go no where and new characters that provide absolutely nothing to the story...I don&#39;t think this is a terrible movie by any means but it just hurts as fan to see what could have been but instead we get an half assed mess to please new fans but not paying much attention to the fans of old, be it the original trilogy or the prequels. As a casual fan you will love this movie but as someone who has invested decades into this franchise it will be a huge disappointment. In my opinion it is better than Rogue One but The force Awakens beats this easily simply because it has much better character development and stays loyal to established lore.",1

The whole point in his change of character was to show that people grow and change and after almost killing your nephew and then losing everything you worked for you aren&#39;t gonna stay the same.

As long as we keep going to the cinema to see this Star Walt Disney and giving them our precious money, they&#39;ll continue to make this kind of garbage. This two films should never be called Eps 7 and 8, they do not belong to the real saga, the main character has nothing to do with the Skywalkers&#39; saga or the meaning of the Force. This is just Disney selling toys and making films to the new generations and the general public, only for making mountains of money. We, the real fans of the saga, will not buy it! Do not let Mickey Mouse fool you! This is NO Star Wars, it&#39;s Star WaltDisney for kids! And for those who say: &quot;take it easy, it&#39;s only a film&quot;. NO, we are talking about Star Wars. It&#39;s more than &quot;only a film&quot;. It means a lot for many people in different generations, it has been more than &quot;only a film&quot; for decades. Let&#39;s respect it. Let&#39;s boycott this nonsense Star WaltDisney! Star Wars is truly a big film with six parts and we can watch its end in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;!",13

Francis Hooton,"Disney, another error in the film is the reference to fuel running out.  In the original trilogy, fuel is never mentioned.  The ships and world, always have plenty of energy,  I don&#39;t think the idea of ships running out of fuel, fits with star wars.  It is making it too human-Earth-orientated.  In the original triology, ships sometimes suffered mechanical breakdowns.  If Rian Johnson wanted to disable ships and destroy characters, he should have thought of another way of doing it.   The way the engines worked in the original trilogy was never mentioned.  The Millenium Falcon suffered mechanics breakdowns, but it never ran out of fuel.  It was the fastest ship in the galaxy.",2

Each experience was very unique in that the various audience members I shared the theater with reacted differently than the previous viewing, adding new layers of appreciation and insight into the film itself.<br><br>As with all things in life, perfection is unattainable, and dwelling on the negative leads only to a clouded recognition of the positive.

Mark Hamill&#39;s role was confusing and depressing; I can see why he didn&#39;t like it. Parts of the movie are taken whole cloth from the original trilogy.  The humor is hit and miss. Luke squeezes a giant animal teet and drinks the milk out of it (seriously). Red salt. <br><br>Just buy the original trilogy and forget anything else ever came after (except maybe the animated clone wars, which I hear was good).",5
Nick Kenner,"I think the theme of this movie is a metaphor for the original movies and obviously life itself, in letting the past die.

I have always seen them as movies for children and teenagers just like ‘Harry Potter’ movies till I watched ‘Rogue One’ which was extraordinary and unique in every way. It was an awesome movie. I thought ‘The Last Jedi’ will be the same, but unfortunately it went back to the same usual star war franchise line. An endless conflict which could last eternally between resistance/rebels and the empire/first order…and between individual magical forced. I can’t understand why people are so impressed with this very ordinary movie other than we really live in a world full of children, teenagers, and lame people!",0

And how luke was treated in this movie  was horrible, sad and pathetic. Good they did not put luke in a jedi self-help group🙄. The Moment he throws the saber over his shoulder destroyed the whole image of a jedi. Chewie was a place holder just to fly the falcon. And what i did not understand is where holdo sees most of all ships are being destroyed before she decides to start her kamikazi attack although her fate was already sealed. Why not at the very first moment? She could have saved so many lives🤔 and this is just one of many questions.<br>Its sad that They wasted a lot of potential.",0

ENFPScorpio,"(Free of Spoilers) It&#39;s a very symbolic film, which is very beautiful, but in all honesty myself and my father left the theatre being a little hurt by the fact we just didn&#39;t enjoy it. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing it again but I have to admit it was the least enjoyable Star Wars movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It was clunky, there were characters who were introduced who provided little to the story, it was a marathon of plot points to the extent that viewing was comparable to running in a stream of water, against the current.This begin said, performances were incredible, I particularly loved Driver, Ridley and Hammil&#39;s parts which were utterly captivating and had me on the edge of my seat, Laura Dern&#39;s appearance as a fantastic (if Hunger Games looking) personality to the normally stock-character good-guy leader, and in direct contrast the complexity and drive of Domnhall Gleeson&#39;s credible Hux. The humour made the beginning of the film alien from any material before it and the end fight scene felt like there was barely a build up, the climax appearing to resonate better with an earlier confrontation in the film. Definitely not a movie you&#39;d wanna miss though.",31

JJ Abrams made a star wars movie, suddenly everyone started to miss the prequels...Rian Johnson made a &#39;movie&#39; about star wars, now JJ Abrams is a genius! I am wondering who has to come to make Rian Johnson look like a genius...thoughts?",1

William Ani-Mation,The movie was amazing!,1
hello,This movie fell victim to the classic if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it syndrome. It was good but with something like star wars...the audience doesn&#39;t want you to stir things up to much...they want some nostalgia and magic. JJ Abrams should be back for the next one and hopefully some of the decision in this movie will be justified in the next one. The original trilogy was built around just a few characters and this one is kind of random as to why the characters are who they are. I thought overall it was a good movie but Luke should have been more honored and I don&#39;t think his attitude in this movie felt very justified or convincing. He seems like the last one who would give up on the Jedi or see them as something that needs to end.,38

Matt,"The Last Jedi, was AMAZING. <br>Ive been a fan for more than 20 years, first seeing A New Hope with my dad and brother. Ive seen every Star Wars released since then, in the theaters. I had very high expectations for every movie released. All the fan boys hating on The Last Jedi are so ungrateful. This Movie exceeded my expectations, had so many plot twists, and was beautifully directed. It left my head spinning, and built up so much hype for episode 9. I heard that Empire Strikes Back also had alot of negative backlash when it was first released. Hands down this was such an amazing Star Wars. Haters.",1

I&#39;m absolutely just horrified with the amount of money Disney has used to fund these writers/directors/producers for Ep. 8. Like how is the idea of the Interim Admiral not telling ANYONE the plan in the time of need gona progress the plot besides the fact for Poe to start a mutiny. No mutiny was needed, like at ALL.

Yes there were some things I didn’t like about it like the whole Finn and rose subplot and I kind of wish they did kill Leigh and Finn but honestly it was a decent Star Wars film. People bashing this film because everyone reads fan theories thinking it’s going to happen but it doesn’t. Star Wars took a new approach that was bold different. I give it a 8/10 personally.,18

Aqueiz,do i have to watch the other star wars movies to understand this?,1
Hugh,This is without a doubt one of the best if not the best movie of the year. Much better than Wonderwoman and Thor Ragnarok. Everything was amazing and coherent. The jokes were spot on and the plot was smooth and easy to understand. I hope they rehire the director to come back and make more of these because they are amazing!!!! I think this is Oscar worthy for best screenplay. The best Star Wars movie from all the rest and probably much better than all the marvel movies combined! Only Star Trek beyond is a bit better but this Star Wars the last Jedi is pretty good too.,1

Newbie52,"The movie was a slightly different style and feel of that of the other films, however it was creative, different than what one would expect in some aspects and downright ballsy in others.

So we get TLJ which is definitely way different than any other movie we&#39;ve seen and people get mad for other reasons. Criticism is so lame, why can&#39;t you guys just accept the fact that Star Wars will change and will not always be exactly the same as it was 40 years ago. It&#39;s just sad that people can&#39;t just realize that their hate comments won&#39;t change anything and aren&#39;t doing any good. I get both sad and annoyed to see so much hate on such an (in my opinion) amazing movie. Its different for sure, but it is not &quot;trash&quot; in any way.",12

AV,"I&#39;ve seen it 4 times already. Once on Friday, 2 times on Saturday (3D, then regular) and again today on Sunday. Safe to say I can&#39;t get enough of this film. Looking back on the trailer, it&#39;s so interesting to add context to these scenes. Also, it&#39;s not worth seeing in 3D if you&#39;re curious. It doesn&#39;t translate well for some reason even though you&#39;d think it would.",101

It's BeeRay,"My old man was 16 when Empire came out and he says this is the exact same reaction that film got. Most people loved it but a sizeable percentage absolutely hated it. Now it’s considered by most to be the best film in the franchise. I’ve been a fan my whole life and I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. Wasn’t a massive fan of the whole casino and animal cruelty thing but I love how bold the film is. Visually, I think it’s by far the best in the franchise and it also had the best lightsaber fight since The Phantom Menace (terrible film but that lightsaber duel and the score were amazing). Anyway, as the old saying goes, “no one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans”.",522

And all those atheists calling the book all sorts of names yet SW fanatics using a Vatican term &quot;canon&quot; to declare what is the approved lore. They should have stopped the movies after ROTJ.

ogorjefan,"In my personal opinion this movie was a blast. Really thoughtful, well executed, dynamic, witty,  colorful, adventureous combined with outstanding performances and incredibly layered characterization this is one of the best films of the year and one of  the best star wars movies. Literally everyone can find something to appreciate here and not only that,  the film is made to be enjoyed by every demographic, you could say it is universal. Plot,  or should i say two main plots are perfectly intertwined to give you that sense of tension, unease and constant anticipation of what might happen and how this whole thing is going to end, because as Luke himself said that this is not going the way we think. I thought he and Rey had great chemistry and comedic moments, humour worked and yes the porgs were used well and moderately and whole theatre laughed including me regarding some chewbacca scenes wtih them. There were some very unique and memorable moments in the movie, really smart choices and unexpected turns, exceptionally well done character humanization, lively direction, gorgeous action set pieces and ending which was so satisfying in its delivery of finding inner HOPE. Job well done Rian Johnson!",0
sacreview,"Rian Johnson completely screwed this up. He obviously has no idea of the characters of this franchise and all Disney wants is money. Rotten tomatoes has it right. 56% that&#39;s how crappy the writing is for this movie. Real content is replaced by cheap one liners, plot holes everywhere, no idea how this universe works at all and 45 mins of nothing related to this story. Rian, you&#39;re a failure",0

And leia was technically a skywalker and had the power to use the force. LUKE is gone so how the heck are you meant to continue the trilogy that is about this character?! You can&#39;t just change the subject because this is meant to be about LUKE. Please share so disney and star wars director of ep 9 could get this.",1

You could almost say the sub-genre was a comedy, a very, very try-hard comedy. Much of the jokes used seemed way too forced and weren&#39;t really funny in general and were just... cringy.

jxsilicon9,"Rey represents our Youth. She is entitled, doesn&#39;t have to train or work at getting better - she is the greatest Jedi ever just because she was born. The only thing missing are the trophies.",9
CinemaRockPizza,The Last Jedi is secretly great and revolutionary in the franchise - until it confronts inappropriately lame and unconventional plot points which obviously don&#39;t fit Rian Johnson&#39;s context of dark and bizarre essence behind the Force and the events.<br>The movie is well-directed but some scenes fail to be clearly impressive due to dictate-the-mood music on the background (although soundtrack is outstanding as always). Most importantly - this movie smartly ironizes the mentality of fanbase and sets the conflict on a potentially interesting rethinking of canons.,0

Емо,Episode 8 is miles better than the previous one. Thankfully it does not feel like a remake and it doesn&#39;t try to mimic the saga. It does things in its own way and it does it nicely. Unlike all other SW movies this one is unpredictable and full of plot twists. It has a strong feeling of Expanded universe around it. Important lessons on the Jedi and the Force. Compared to this movie a lot of the previous ones feel blank and unewentful.<br><br>Some people might not like how the story or certain characters turn out but that isn&#39;t a reason to dislike the Episode 8. May the Force be with you.,2

Mike Dyer,What if Rey can&#39;t fend of the call to the darkside and turns complete dark and then Finn finds out he has the force in an extraordinary way and stays good because his whole motivation is to save Rey from herself who ends up joining Snoke so Finn learns the force from Luke and Maz and Kylo is so confused with the force that he turns Grey Jedi and he&#39;s the chosen one to balance the force between them once and for all. Luke &amp; Snoke are like the coaches/grandmasters for each side of the force. Leia dies unfortunately but gifts the military &amp; her power to Poe who ends up making it the finest it&#39;s ever been. Stretch this over two movies &amp; light the fireworks.<br>-Mike Dyer,0

Guy Toigo,Do you guys think we can dedicate this film to the memory of Carrie Fisher?,0
muzictherpy,"same story talked again and again, huh..",0
Terrance Burton,"I think the first order, specifically smoke and kylo, are trying to bring back darth Vader and maybe they need a Jedi to do it, thus why Luke went into hiding? Idk",0
jonny pepperston,that part with snoke and that part with kylo ren are part of a vision,0
bfsd150,So I wonder who the main villain is going to be in this one. Maybe Luke? Maybe Luke turns to the dark side and Rey has to actually train really hard to defeat him. That would be an interesting twist. But I don&#39;t think fans of Luke Skywalker would like that very much. Maybe that Snoke creature or they put in some new powerful Sith lord character that Rey has to defeat and she has to actually train to do it because unlike with her last Darth Vader wannabe opponent using the force to automatically gain the skill to use a lightsaber will not be enough this time. I mean Rey has to be training to stop some threat right? So I&#39;m curious who&#39;s going to be the big threat this time. Certainly not Mr. Darth Vader wannabe Ren. He&#39;s not a threat anymore. Rey has already wiped the floor with him. She did it once with no training. She could do it again. Hopefully we get another more powerful villain and the final battle is not Kylo losing a lightsaber duel to Rey a second time because we&#39;ve already seen that.,0

Eemeli Lounela,"So just based on the trailer, a little prediction:<br><br>The begining: AT-AT are probably attacking something... lets&#39;s say a rebel base (or whatever they are called now), but they are fought of by smaller, but quiker vehicles (probably using clever tactics to out smart a better armed foe).<br><br>Middle: Rey wants Luke to train him, but Luke refuses because Rey can&#39;t control the force and Luke fears she will turn to dark side. Frustrated Rey leaves to help his friends who are in trouble (space battle).<br><br>End: Kylo tries to persuade Ray to join him on the dark side. (Rey is tempted to agree but?) eventually she refuses and proceeds to fight Kylo. She loses her hand (or possibly a leg) in the fight (maybe because Snoke turns up to help Kylo? (seem bit radical tough)).<br><br>So there it is the main plot of Empire Stri... I mean The Last Jedi. Oh and I&#39;m really sorry for spoilers.",1

DeeZeed,"Here&#39;s what i think will happen, Rey goes to Luke but Luke gives her nothing, Kylo in turn encourages her to seek Snoke for answers and is willing to give everything she wants. At the same time Kylo has conflict within him, Killing his father didn&#39;t create the power he so desired and may even have made him weaker thus he hesitates to kill his own mother Leia. Snoke in turn seeing how powerful Rey is decides he doesn&#39;t need Kylo who he deems weak and a failure. Kylo realising that his father Han and Lor San Tekka was telling him the truth turns against Snoke and tries to save Rey but it&#39;s too late and Rey falls into Snokes manipulation and Kylo is not strong enough to defeat Snoke. This forces him to seek an alliance with the very man he betrayed his uncle thus we get Snoke and Rey on one side and Luke and Kylo on the other. Essentially a redemption arc where Kylo must seek and gain back what he lost alone as neither Chewie, the resistance or even Finn want anything to do with him.",0

TheTruthSyrum,"Script leak. Hey guys. Rey&#39;s parents were Leia and Han Solo. After Snoke seduced Kylo and while training him, Liea and Han hid Rey with Han&#39;s friend, which is why he has the Millennium Falcon. Han says he stole it because Han didn&#39;t want to give it up, in other words he got it at a &quot;steal&quot;. Kylo returned with the knights of Ren and killed off the new Jedi Order. Rey is Kylo&#39;s fraternal twin. Kylo got taken at an early age to the new Jedi order under Luke, and never knew his sister, since his talents came early and Rey showed no real power, her&#39;s was latant like luke&#39;s was. Padme had twins, this trait usually carries on with any daughters genetically. Not to mention the actress who plays Rey said it&#39;s pretty obvious who her real parents are in the Force Awakens. Now you know why Rey has as mucn raw power as Kylo. Top that with Rey being recognized by both Han and Liea, and in fact encouraged. Rey is Kylo&#39;s twin sister.",0

nectaron,Rey is a female clone of Anakin Skywalker. im telling you now. When Obi-Wan beat Anakin on Mustafar his potential became limited. Palpatine then started a secret campaign to try to clone Anakin. All of them were fails because none of the clones was as force sensitive as the original. The work to create this prefect clone was later continued by Snoke and a female clone of Anakin was a success. However Ray was spirited away by someone before Snoke got his claws on her.,72

Guilherme Leme,"My thoughts on this. <b>Trailer spoilers below...</b><br><br><br><br>1. Kylo was brainwashed by Snoke just like Rey will be, and that&#39;s how he turned to the dark side. Some minor plots might have contributed to that.<br>2. Luke reluctantly starts to train Rey. Meanwhile, Kylo is recovering from his injuries and is preparing for a mission to kidnap Rey while confronting Luke.<br>2. Kylo not only succeeds on that mission, but he also kills Luke (Leia senses it on that cut that looks like Kylo is shooting her ship).<br>3. As soon as Kylo delivers Rey to Snoke, the Supreme Leader commands his Praetorian Guards to kill Kylo (the scene where he picks up his lighsaber from the floor with a red background), for there can be only one Master and one Pupil, and Rey is far more powerful then Kylo. <br>4. Kylo manages to kill the Guards and threatens Snoke. Snoke then deceivably tells Kylo that he can prove his value one last time by killing his own mother.<br>5. Kylo accepts the mission at first, but he is totally lost in an identity chrisis. That&#39;s when he breakes his mask, he&#39;s starting to see through Snoke&#39;s lies.<br>6. Kylo meets Leia while trying to carry on his mission, but he&#39;s completely lost about his own identity. Ultimately he can&#39;t kill his own mother, while realizing he was deceived this entire time by Snoke, that&#39;s the scene when he extends his hand, he&#39;s doing that to Leia. Kylo becomes Ben Solo again, he comes back to the light, and then he becomes the Last Jedi.<br>7. By the end Snoke succeeds on destroying Rey&#39;s mind and she turns to the dark side. Ben Solo is the only remaining hope to confront Snoke and save Rey from his grasp and the dark side.",18

His outfit is not the new one.. no cape and the belt and fabrics different.. he&#39;s wearing his ep. 7 clothes. more than likely this is from the vision we saw in tfa right after he betrays Luke and destroys the temple. More than likely this is Luke he is with and he is telling his defeated former master &quot;Now Give me back my lightsabre&quot;.

Faisal Memon,"The Star Wars feel is gone. Every director is gonna bring his own vision and influences to the movie. Star Wars has to be influenced by Star Wars alone. Lucas made some crappy prequels but JJ totally destroyed everything that is Star Wars. And Star Wars has now become just another space movie. Force Awakens was just a setup for Last Jedi, and I&#39;m afraid Last Jedi will be a setup for the next one. At least Lucas made each episode complete and whole and gave something new in every movie not counting the bad CGI though. The new Star Wars movies are gonna make money because of the hype and not because we are actually excited to see them.",15

I asked her if she wanted to come over and have a starwas marathon with me. She told me she had never seen star wars, Wich through me off a lot but also made me happy because I would be the one to show her star wars. So she came over, I had made popcorn and gotten soda and everything was going perfect and during the movie we talked and our conversation got more and more intamate. And at the end of episode 4 she kissed me (we watched the original first). The night only got better from there. Finally we finished the original and so we watched episode one and she told me she had a boyfriend. And then told me that she doesn&#39;t know what she had been thinking. Then she left my apartment crying and telling me to go away. I never got to talk to her again",0

With the type of character he is, saying that he wouldn&#39;t run away to Leia, and having to resist the temptation of the emperor, he was proven to be very strong willed, which I think is what lead him to overcome his mistake of running off from Yoda&#39;s training. Running away now from his problems doesn&#39;t seem like him. I won&#39;t judge yet with minimal details at this point, but I hope it is for a very exceptional reason.",0

ZOOM Station,How cool would it be if Kylo actually pulled the trigger and shoots the ship  but jumps out of his cockpit lands his ship inside that the blowing up ship and rescues her and jumps back in this ship with her before the big ship totally erupts? That would be the coolest scene ever in Star Wars cinema. He then and hides her on a planet because couldn&#39;t kill her and doesn&#39;t want Snoke to know he wussed out.

Slechy Lesh,"Some insider info here on why else you should boycott Star Wars<br><br>A - Disney won&#39;t allow any cinema to show Star Wars OFF date. Off date means not opening on the official opening weekend<br><br>B - If any cinema wants to show Star Wars they must show it 4 times a day every day from opening night until the next Friday<br><br>What does this mean?<br><br>When a film is released tickets are bought by film loving audience folk (us).<br><br>The money we pay for the ticket is split between the Cinema and the Distributer (Disney).<br><br>For a studio blockbuster this split is usually 50/50 (fair one).<br><br>For an indie film the split is 65/35 in favour of the cinema (it&#39;s a riskier venture for the cinema to show a film that may not recoup any ££) (fair one)<br><br>When a cinema takes a blockbuster OFF date the Box Office split can be re-negotiated to favour the cinema who can ask for 60% or 65% of the ticket cost. <br><br>However for the new Star Wars, Disney have said no to any OFF dates and at the same time have imposed up to an 80/20 split.<br><br>You read that right, Disney are taking up to 80% of ticket costs. At the same time using &quot;the force&quot; to make small cinemas with 1 or 2 screens show 4 times a day.<br><br>This cripples both smaller cinemas and smaller films who cannot run during those weeks. <br><br>Some cinemas, I hear, just cannot commit to this deal and so lose out to Odeon, Vue etc who can commit.<br><br>But how does this affect me??<br><br>1-Higher cinema ticket costs and rising (ALL cinemas have to raise the cost of a ticket, at some point, to make this 1 deal sustainable and to cover their costs) <br><br>2-Independent cinemas lose out on what will be the highest grossing film of the year, places like Chapter in Cardiff which is run by 200 VOLUNTEERS and other local cinemas that have 1 screen and under 50 seats seats (there&#39;s not even enough people in that town to watch it 4 times a day)<br><br>3-That 80% (£8 of your £10 ticket) that Disney force from cinemas is re-distributed to people like Harrison Ford who commanded $25million for approx 4 weeks work for the Force Awakens and who could well be on a bigger back end profits deal. (Context; newcomers Daisy Ridley white British woman and John Boyega black British man earned approx £500k between them for the Force Awakens, 12 weeks work, no back end profits deal)",0

Blackholelord,"I want to state one additional thing. I time to time check out the Star Wars wiki site to see what they come up for the new stuff in Rebels and the new films, and discover something rather unique. I have seen fans who are happy that the old cannon universe is no longer around, how the books, comics and games were no longer cannon as it was confusing for them. Just limited to the movies, Clone Wars and Rebels. <br>I got you a news flash for you guys!!!!<br>Disney has introduced new books, new comics and new games to the new cannon universe. And its all considered cannon!!!! That right, what you hated about the old cannon, is back!!! The news flash is this, Disney is doing the same thing to make one thing... MONEY!!!!! Because Stars Wars is a billion dollar business. It will eventually get the point where you have no idea what this additional stuff means, but there it is. The new cannon is Disney way to make a entire new universe on their own terms, all the old stuff is now reference stuff to be used in the new cannon universe, because several stuff from Rebels were never reveal no where other than in the games, before moving to comics and novels in the old cannon. <br>You hated the stuff. Guess what you are dealing with the stuff. Forty years later, and it will likely be as big as the old cannon, with confusing stuff you don&#39;t understand. The old cannon will likely be remember by only old die hard fans. <br>Projects for the Legend universe have been cancel by Disney, and I personally have not heard a thing about new stuff being produced. They will focus on their stuff they want, anything related to the old world is forgotten. This is what we deal with.",3

Instead of sitting there being like &quot;well I saw that coming light years away.&quot; <br>I personally like the teaser more because it doesn&#39;t point the direction of the plot anywhere, just leaves you guessing and filled with curiosity, good music very little dialogue and lots of epic shots.

His past? Her past?

Casey Cates,I think when Kylo is picking up his light saber in the beginning it goes along with Snoke later saying Fulfill your Destiny.  I think Snoke is talking to Kylo as Snoke has Rey in a hold and wanting him to kill her so she won&#39;t become a Jedi.,0

Tre'Day,Upon looking at the last fight in episode 7 between Ray and Kylo I just noticed the moment she channeled the force after he said it her movement were more aggressive. Seem to me Rey was fighting through pure anger which explains why she was able to defeat Kylo. The dark side gets its strength from it. In comparison Rey at the time had more rage. She even went as far as to scar this dude after she disarmed him(Was that necessary?). I&#39;d say if  she was more skilled maybe she aimed to kill him right then and there.,0

It could be that Luke didnt want Rey to turn to dark side because of Reys immense potential that could reach for power beyond Luke&#39;s powers.But if it was Palpatine.

She didn&#39;t do out of evil, but untamed raw power that he couldn&#39;t control. She&#39;ll find out Luke abandoned her and feel conflicted and flirt with the Darkside through Kylo",0

Michael Blue,"I think Snoke found a way to stay alive somehow absorbing the force from others. A force vampire. He created anakin for this reason to be his unlimited battery. However sidious either realized this or simply sought to kill his master for his own reason. This did not happen. However I feel Sidious failed in his mission to kill his master. So for decades, palgueis/Snoke went into hiding. Too weak to face off against his apprentice and the jedi. So he waited and attempted to regain his strength, probably went to various force centric places to absorb its energy to heal. But to no avail he couldn&#39;t regain his old power. So when Sidious and his child/battery anakin died. He would then attempt to<br>Seduce Luke or leia since they held massive potential in the force. But he&#39;d later realize it would be too dangerous. Since both are light-side users. So he created another child, Rey. To be his most powerful battery yet. Luke/leia whomever found this out and placed Rey on that planet, to keep her safe. So now he seduced Kylo and is using him for energy until he finds Rey.",6

Jar Dolph,"for a STAR WARS looks REALLY SUCKIE, who was the casting Director, is this a Commercial Version cause it sure LOOKS and FEELS like a Fan Made Version, I will NOT see this until after it&#39;s released [and the OMG Bad Reviews pour in], the Wookie is too animated, and his little Penguin friend looks like JarJar the Bird Rev 2.1 OMG NOT Again!  This has No FEELING of Power of Mystery or Adventure, it feels like a Cut and Paste of the past w/ quickie CGI Updates. NOT IMPRESSED, is this your BEST, well then, its NOT Good Enuf!!! RATED PG-BORING! Looks like Amateur Hour takes to the Big Screen, that doode with the bad tatoo across his face looks like he needs to return to Revenge of the Nerds. The little lady with the shaking 1D 70&#39;s Light Saber [side shots] looks like she needs to take Acting 201 to learn how NOT to shake in such a Fakey  way! Re Cast, Re Shoot, make Star Wars 2017 style, not a bad remake of old Equipment that looks NOT REAL ENUF, w/ the $$$$ behind this, you could DO MUCH and MUCH MUCH BETTER!! this looks and sounds like the Rough Draft, not the FINAL CUT!",0

Sillychimera943,"This new trilogy by Disney had messed everything up, they made it more melodramatic but the fact that they really took George Lucas out of the picture is not great since he started it and he was the one to finish it. <br>The idea that Luke couldn&#39;t keep the Jedi Order in place does not come from Kylo Ren being influenced by the dark side, but by the fact that Luke had a picture-perfect mindset.<br>Luke is wise to not meddle with what is not his destiny to do so, he knows that the Jedi themselves have been corrupt from the fact that the Jedi of the Old Republic was too into &#39;leisure&#39; after the &#39;Rule of Two&#39; had been put into place, which had caused the Jedi Order to be lazy, and be so blocked by the Dark Side because of that and their egoist greed, the Sith were smarter to not be as leisured as the Jedi.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that Luke will turn to the dark side, but he will start to lean towards the Gray side, which is neutral and the one in between. The Sith are evil and dishonourable, The Jedi are greedy and leisured, and the Grey are what Luke wants to become, neutral and in between all this conflict.",0

Werty_91,"I feel when Snoke says &quot;Fulfill your Destiny&quot; he is talking to Luke and not Rey or Kylo. Snoke appears to hold the Vader bloodline in high esteem, so the further away he gets from Vader in terms of descendents, the weaker it may be. But without knowing for sure Rey&#39;s parents we can&#39;t compare her ability with Kylo in terms of the bloodline. And we can say arguably that Luke was in fact stronger than his father, so it makes sense for Snoke to try after him especially since he was so close to the dark side once before.",1

The tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",0

JM,"This isn&#39;t a solid theory whatsoever, merely a passing thought; but what if Rey is significantly older than she is portrayed to be? Those etchings inside her home on Jakku are not days, but years. There was an odd moment in TFA where she gazes at an elderly lady, the reason for that inclusion has always puzzled me. She never mentions that she is waiting for her parents, she simply says &quot;family&quot;, and the boyfriend exchange with Finn is also an notable scene. I wonder if we are supposed to focus on whether she is a plausible daughter of one of the existing characters, when in fact this is misdirection and her parents may date back a great deal further than we think. Again, just a thought, but I&#39;m sure a theory could be built on this somewhat, I was always led to believe Jedi could live longer than non force users....",0

Mika Visser,"To be fair, you have to have a very high amount of Midichlorians to understand the Star Wars prequels. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the high ground most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Anakin’s whiny outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the Midichlorian capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Star Wars prequels truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Anakin’s existential catchphrase “I don’t like sand,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Twelve Years A Slave. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as George Lucas’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂<br><br>And yes, by the way, i DO have a Jar Jar Binks tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within a range of 5% of Midichlorians in their blood of my own capacity (preferably lower) beforehand.

Josh giddey fan account,My theory as to who Rey’s parents are is Emporor Palpatine. You can clearly here palpatines force dash noice from episode 3 when Rey turns on her lightsaber. Also what destiny would snoke want Rey to fulfill is she was a skywalker. Snoke would want to use Rey because of her lineage and ties to Palpatine also because of her obvious force power. Rey means king in old Spanish language so that is also another tie to Palpatine.,2

Joel Hill,Now no doubt this will causes some opinions and before is start I would like to say I don&#39;t dislike the people I just dislike what they do but that&#39;s there choice I don&#39;t have the right to judge. <br><br>My comment is.. is anyone else hoping they don&#39;t put a homosexual in this film. Reason I&#39;m asking is I just watched the new ep star trek discovery last night and once again we are forced a homosexual even tho the story didn&#39;t need or benefit from there being one. There seams to be this trend at the moment where a person of that sexuality is shown off as a amazing person who we should all love even tho it&#39;s takes away from the story think back to the last star trek film what dose everyone remember from that film bet it wasn&#39;t the story I can&#39;t even remember the name of it all I remember is the fact that zulu is a homosexual and that because it was forced even the original actor of zulu said it was too forced. When you do that it takes the whole focus of the movie off the story and on to them. <br><br>Now this is far from being star wars but downtown Abbey did it best that show had the butler who was a homosexual but it wasn&#39;t forced in your face he was just a part of the story and he wasn&#39;t shown off as this amazing person infact he was the villain of a number of episodes so if your gonna add someone like that in do it so the people who don&#39;t care can still enjoy the story without it being forced in your face. <br><br>Personally I would like it of they just stopped adding them in to movies or storys not becuse I dislike them but because it takes away from the story.<br><br>In ten years we should look back on this star wars as having a great story we should not look back in 10 years as this being the first star wars with a homosexual that&#39;s not what star wars was about.<br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say is if you wanna have a homosexual in a story add them on the first ep or first movie don&#39;t add them half way through just for the sake of it. Star trek was about the crew saving the galaxy exploring the galaxy and getting in to trouble it was never about who likes who but that&#39;s what it&#39;s like today. Star was has always been about good battling evil and that how it should stay. <br><br>In a nutshell don&#39;t add them just for publicity or just for the sake of it if your gonna add them do it so it dosnt come across as being this big part of the story.<br> Now please don&#39;t send hate all I wanna know is dose anyone else feel the same or is it just me. I will delete this comment if it gets to much attention. And I don&#39;t dislike homosexual people I just don&#39;t agree with what they do but what they do is there choice and I&#39;m not judging because it&#39;s not my place,1

LDN Sabers,"My theory is, snoke will kill leia in a space battle scene which he sends orders to fire a missile at the ship. luke senses a disturbance is the force, so does rey. Rey goes to try and saves resistance. get&#39;s captured.  Luke is pretty much no. if you do, it wont go how you think. luke feels rey in danger. Luke senses a presence on arch to turns around and it&#39;s ben solo,  broken and he knows he needs to save rey before it&#39;s too late. he needs Luke help. Luke is very no, you destroyed everything of mine. He then tells Luke that there cousins, that he took her and left her on jakku. because he couldn&#39;t kill her at the academy he then reaches his hand out. and both go to fight snoke. Luke Scarifies him self at the end so they can get away.",0
rockyourassed,"In my opinion i either see Kylo turning to the good side of the force after some acts of redemption, trained by Luke, while Rey would turn to the dark side of the force cause her powers never been seen such Luke era, which seems to be a loooong time ago. Or Kylo and Rey will train together , joining the good and dark side of the force, cause they can&#39;t be separated from eachother, to face something so evil, so powerful that was never seen before even with Palpatine. Then they would become the best Jedi/Sith ever saw even if Kylo is not one, but he would be an Enlightened Sith, staying in the dark maybe but not getting leaded by his pulsions cause he found his own peace, while Rey would be the greatest Jedi who ever lived next to Yoda.",0

I&#39;m not the world&#39;s biggest Star Wars fan by any measure, but the conscious effort to dislike something that is by its nature an entertainment is weird.

CK Riddikan,"Snoke is Darth Plagueis.<br>Ray has no father, she was created by Plagueis the same way like Anakin.<br>Snoke will try to recruit and use his creation.",0
Johann Popper,"Kind of... boring. <br><br>1) The music is not as melodic, and therefore not as memorable. Leitmotifs have been toned down to basically one recognizable short piece describing Kylo Ren. This is no doubt due to JJ Abrams despising heavy melodic scores -- as he himself states in various Lost interviews -- but heavy melodic scores are the audible hallmark of Star Wars. Quick, hum Finn&#39;s theme! You can&#39;t. Because these movies don&#39;t have a good producer, and it&#39;s a disservice to the talents involved. Finn deserves a mythic presence. Poe deserves a presence, etc. Now hum Leia&#39;s theme, Luke&#39;s theme, the Force theme, Lando&#39;s theme, Yoda&#39;s, Vader&#39;s/Imperial, etc. Easy. To an incalculable degree, the original musical style was, along with Ralph McQuarrie&#39;s visual style, the reason why Star Wars touched the hearts of millions. Which brings me to my next criticism.<br><br>2) JJ is not adhering to the Ralph McQuarrie art style for ship, environment, and costume designs. McQuarrie&#39;s style was vivid clear simple shapes (circles, triangles, X&#39;s) in easy to understand and visually distinct environments, almost German Expressionist combined with dirty realism, and the costumes and uniforms were similarly streamlined and simple. That is the Star Wars look. Like a comic. Idealistic, with just enough dirt to seem lived in. All the new designs are derivative and weird, just odd recombinations of old designs that lack the distinctive simplicity of the originals. You don&#39;t just take a Star Destroyer, squish it down and add a few pointless gaps in the hull and... done! No. The entire thing just looks tribal and over-complex and fanfic-ish. The simple sci-fi shapes of Darth Vader&#39;s helmet are nowhere to be seen. Star Wars is supposed to look like retro sci-fi serials with some added realism. That whole retro vibe is lost in the new trilogy. Everything is highly detailed (without any bold retro art deco lines) superimposed over much less recognizable shapes. None of the environments are unique and clearly distinct from each other or environments in past films. For example, Luke&#39;s island sanctuary on an ocean planet used the same color palette as Maz Kanata&#39;s mountainous river-jungle planet in the same movie! It was visually confusing. George Lucas would never have done that. Each of his films (the originals) had distinct looks throughout, indicating phases of the story. <br><br>3) The story. Who are the protagonists? What do the apparent antagonists want? The audience has no idea. Nobody works together for long, we&#39;re never told where the First Order came from, whether the Galactic Civil War is still raging or what&#39;s happening with the New Republic. In the original, you&#39;ve got an empire, so the audience is like, &quot;Sure, so there&#39;s an emperor. That&#39;s all we need to know.&quot; The Empire is destroyed. Yay. Now, we&#39;ve got this supremely powerful Supreme Leader of the First Order. Who? What? The sequel should be about how these things come to be, not just what feels like a random rehash of old ideas. It&#39;s like the new trilogy is over-shooting the mark away from all the political machinations of the prequels into a completely incoherent territory where there is simply no story at all -- worse, the writers are deconstructing the plain ethical superiority of the light side of the Force that was the moral of the first two trilogies! Hence, my ethical problem with it.<br><br>4) Ethics. Clearly, this new trilogy is being written from a Gnostic/Manichaean point of view, a sort of blend of eternal good and evil cosmologies, leading to gray Jedi or the pointlessness of all the heroics of the original trilogy or whatever. It&#39;s like it&#39;s written by a clinically depressed person. All very very boring and misses the ENTIRE point of the original trilogy. The original trilogy even had some interesting secondary political commentary on centralized control versus distributive control. We have no idea what the New Republic stands for. We have no idea what the Resistance is -- where&#39;s the Republic&#39;s ships? I just can&#39;t go on. The reason why people liked Star Wars was articulated perfectly by Stephen Spielberg, who said it gave people in dark times a clear and simple spiritual message of good versus evil. It&#39;s a mythic tale that&#39;s supposed to make reality better for the audience, not a 6 hour lament about nothing. There is absolutely nothing sophisticated about commenting on the ambiguity of good and evil. It&#39;s just so achingly boring. I can&#39;t even keep my eyes open watching it. It&#39;s not for kids anymore. You know who the new trilogy is written by and for? Kids who grew up into very ancient jaded depressed people who don&#39;t even realize this about themselves. Kids, of course, just want Luke Skywalker saving the galaxy and his father, and a princess giving him a medal, and the good guys are actually the good guys and they win. This is actually psychologically sick. These movies are being made for depressed millennial child-parents as salt to pour into their 1st world wounds, while their children just sort of sit there confused about all the nonsense they&#39;re seeing on the screen, while their sick parents tell them how much they&#39;re supposed to like it like they did. Wow. Warped. <br><br>5) A minor complaint, but what the hell happened to script-writing skill in America? You do not -- unless you&#39;re going to somehow blow me away with an obvious twist -- put the same vocabulary into the mouths of two different characters. Unless by some cosmic cluster Luke and Snoke are one and the same, don&#39;t have Snoke refer to &quot;raw power&quot; and then have Luke say the same thing in the same movie, never mind in the same trailer! It&#39;s so amateurish to make the audience realize all the characters are written by the same person, being fed the exact same lines, especially over such a lame and immersion-murdering phrase as &quot;raw power&quot;. My 8 year old self would&#39;ve rolled his eyes. Honestly, this is very basic, and should not be an issue in a huge Disney production. <br><br>6) You moved Kylo&#39;s scar. Seriously? lol wow lame.<br><br>7) &quot;This is not going to go the way you think!&quot; Picard sigh. I&#39;m done. <br><br>So, yeah, I can&#39;t like it yet. The next two will probably be more of the same. And to make matters worse, most everyone on all sides of the debate over the direction of this new series does not understand what&#39;s right or wrong with it. All these comments about feminism and race or whatever completely miss the point. The main differences are #1-4 of what I just described. These are the dealbreakers. I hope the next film gets it right....<br><br>Of course, I could be completely wrong. Hope so. Hope the trailer is all misdirects, and the next two films will be great.",0

Star Wars always was a SCIFI-fairytale, it is a pity that Disney isn&#39;t capable to bring good fairy tales to the screen anymore. All this want-to-be mystery mingled into overlong 3D-action-sequences is ruining films for long enough now.

Habu,"Yeah... mostly the same feeling I&#39;ve had watching the trailer for Force Awakens. Goosebumps, then the disappointment when I&#39;ve sat through it in cinema. I might go to see this one as well, but just out of curiosity, how much unoriginal it will be again. From what we can see here in the trailer, Luke is the new Yoda, Rey is the new Luke and the movie will end in a baddies-sort-of-win fashion, just like in episode V.",0

Dragonfire Gaming,"Possible spoilers ahead.. you have been warned 😂<br>Luke is the father ( grey ) (( because in the promo poster, the light sabers of Rey and of Kylo are both refracting off of him equally. As if he were split between both light and dark, which is called a grey Jedi.))<br>Rey is the daughter ( she can control the raw power in the kyber Chrystal in the sky walker family saber, to inflict damage, which is how she cracked the stone) (( and also possibly, how after gaining the saber from Maz Kanata’s castle, she was able to master the forces abilities of “mind meld” and of “ Lightsaber dueling”.. this could also be how she had the force vision.. it was the Kyber crystal, not the lightsaber itself, hat gave her the force vision.)) ((( because the daughter is known to be able to control blue, white, and green kyber crystals)))<br>The son is kylo, (who represents the dark, whom is conflicted within himself.) ((the son is also known to be slightly unstable.. which is not only reflected in kylo’s demeanor, but also in his lightsaber. ))<br>The mother or abeloth is Shmi, ( Anakin’s mother, she represents the mother because she controlled the mitochlorians to create anakin.... when quigon goes to the roof to phone the Jedi counsel talking about anakin.. Shmi ( who walks with a limp) somehow teleports up to the roof and smirks at quigon<br><br>Abeloth or “ The mother” was originally the first human women ever created, whom was created from the force.. she eventually drank from the fonts of the force, the pools of knowledge ( The daughter, light side) the pools of power( the son, dark side) and the pool of ( forgetting the name) (( the father, the grey)) and gained the powers of all three and went insane, where she was locked away by The Ones, as she was too powerful to fight. Even for them. (( many years later tho it is Luke who kills her, ((( comics))) becoming the most powerful being in creation. (((( he become even more powerful after reading the books.. more on that later))))<br><br><br>In the trailer, snoke is torturing Rey, possibly to make what happened before( daughter and son kill eachother) come to pass again Rey and kylo are trying to team up to stop that from happening<br><br><br><br>The dust from the kyber crystals reacts and starts floating because Rey ( the daughter ) touches them once again and they react to the return of her light energy.<br><br>The tree with the books, is what I believe to be, the tree of life.<br><br>The books within the tree are the cosmic books, written by The Ones, they describe in probable detail, the events of the universe, everything from the force’s creation and its end. And most likely, hold the powers of the ones and how to access them.<br><br>Each book in the tree of life represent a side of the force. The books of the force are at the tree’s core to represent even after life of the tree ends , the three sides of the force, will remain.. luke is on the island alone because he is the protector of these books, he probably read each of the books written by The Ones, and gained the powers of all three(( which could explain how he is a grey Jedi and why he left the lightsaber in Maz Kanata’s castle, he believes the way of the Jedi, is not the way to achieve peace, that also explains the very final line in the first trailer of “ The Last Jedi “ where Luke says” It’s time for the Jedi.. to end”. Rey approaching the books means she will also gain the powers.<br><br>When anakin died he released all the good light force energy in his core into the ground of mustafar and it turned into dark energy making the dark kyber crystals more powerful<br>That’s why kylo and the knights of ren were on mustafar ( shown by the lava and the falcon flying by red kyber crystals) they are building an army with the empowered crystals to take down snoke and stop the cycle of the ones<br><br><br>After the ones died, their force energy’s could have imprinted on Anakin and his blood line( mitochlorians, force whatever) he was there when the son and daughter tore each other apart, and when the father faded; slight offset, it kinda makes sense why kylo ( the son) wouldn’t be as powerful as Rey( the daughter) because most of Anakin’s dark force energy was released on mustafar, when his eyes turned molten it signified not only when he turned “ Evil” but also when he was releasing all of his dark energy when he was so angry at Obi Wan ((( also slight side note, this could make sense, since the sith motto is kinda “ use your anger”)))<br><br>My thoughts on the name of the title of the 8th installment of Star Wars. “The last Jedi”. Simply that since Luke is no longer Jedi after reading the books, that Rey will also follow the grey Jedi oath.<br><br>Also I believe that Rey is a Clone of Luke.. if we remember, Lukes’ hand was severed in the reactor of cloud city.. it fell where it was deposited into a trash heap.. we know a clone of Luke was made and turned Evil ( this was all in the comics) but the chances are high that they could have used his dna and inserted it into the egg of a female women whose force senses are already really strong, ( If they don’t want to put Mara jade in the story as the girlfriend/ wife of Luke as she was in the comics, then this is how they would explain her, or give a slight node to the comics.)<br><br>The one problem... the ones are all old canon which completely offsets everything that I just wrote. 😭😭😭",6

Mauler,So I am going to list everything I see and think <br>Kylo looking out the window<br>1.First Order TIE fighters<br>2.crap tone of AT-AT&#39;s <br>3.crap tone of AT-ST&#39;s<br>When Snoke is possibly speaking to Kylo Ren or Rey I feel like when he says &#39;untamed power&#39; &#39;and beyond that&#39; &#39;something truly special&#39; it almost sounds like he is being emotional  with his words.<br>When Luke says &#39;I&#39;ve seen this raw strength only once before it didn&#39;t scare me enough then it does now&#39; I thinking he is talking about Kylo Ren. <br>When Kylo Ren is having his moment in his Tie Silencer he is trying to convince himself this is the life he wants he wants to being on the dark side of the spectrum.<br>Just after the little clip with Finn and Phasma I see a First Order Dreadnaught and a couple dozen rebel ships BUT I see something else in the background I don&#39;t know what it is but it almost looks like the Supremacy but turned sideways so it is like a sword pointing DOWN with 1 end.<br> I got this when I was playing Battlefront 2 I think Rey is going to be a Grey Jedi sort of person just because of her clothes the only other person who has PUBLICLY wore colours like that infront of force sensitives is Anakin.<br>Lastly at the end of the trailer it is either some sort of force vision test for KYLO and I mean KYLO because why would Rey be talking to herself in her vision or REYLO theory has come true.,0

Scorpius,Rey turns to the dark side and Kylo gets convinced by his mother to turn back to the light side. I believe Luke saying he has seen the power before and not being scared  then but scared now is referencing Rey as Palpatine&#39;s decendant. What better way of a movie plot by  Luke training a decendant of the enemy he helped destroy with his father (Vader). Kylo was so fawned of Vader he might learn of the true outcome of his Grandfather and lean back to the light side. Just a theory plot but I would like to know what y&#39;all think.,0

Akame Hakurei,"Dear Star Wars, I just wanted record a message for you to help you understand what i&#39;m trying to say okay. Ready? Ok ehem<br><br><br>Star Wars is the Best thing i love and also i love some Lightsaber scenes and blasters and more. But what i&#39;m trying to say is the Problem with Star Wars is that When there are Lightsaber duels, and when a Person gets shot or Hand cut it means there injured but not just injured, it was supposed to have Blood. Because for me, Blood actually make sense while shot or slashed. I remembered watching a new hope star wars episode 4 i remembered the Cantina scene where luke gets thrown in a Table and Obi wan pulls out his saber and sliced one of an allien&#39;s arm and it had Blood. But Right Now it&#39;s making it a kids movie and there are gonna be Lightaaber duels and if there isn&#39;t gonna be blood in the last jedi. My Fates will be crushed down because i thought star wars is gonna be great but no it&#39;s not gonna be great since star wars is now licensed by disney, then there isn&#39;t gonna be the third game of star wars the force unleashed. I really don&#39;t understand why star wars is for kids? It supposed to have Brutal Deaths and Blood and also Bleeding, but now everything is crushed down and I hate to say this but, Please Star Wars make The Last Jedi good with Blood and Brutal Deaths and it will make me <a href=""http://happy.so/"">Happy.so</a> Please 😭😭😭<br>Like i said, Blood makes sense in movies even though Carrie Fisher has Passes away and also the Voice of yoda had also passes away so please. Make it good.😭😭😭. That&#39;s all for today star wars. Thank you for listening what I&#39;m Trying to say I really appreciate that. And please you&#39;re gonna make star wars Great Brutal,Blood,Violence,Last but not least,sigh Gore <br><br>Again thank you for listening. Be sure to make star wars great again May the Force Be with you. Always and Have a Great Day. 😞😞😞",0

DalionHeart-TTV,"Prediction: Luke turns his back on Rey, which pushes her into a depressed desperation to find her place in the universe. Snoke senses her raw power as she flees the planet and takes to the stars, turning her back against Luke and the rebellion as well. She runs to Kylo who takes her under his wing in order to corrupt and train her. Somewhere near the end or middle of the movie, Kylo is forced to go to war against the rebels and he ultimately fails to kill his mother. Snoke strikes out at Kylo, killing his mother in retaliation. Kylo, faced with all that he had done up until that point realizes that he was wrong about which side were the good guys. He turns against the dark side and ultimately against Snoke, who by that point had already begun twisting the mind of Rey, turning her into a dark lord.<br><br>I&#39;m probably wrong, but that&#39;s what theories are for. To be tested against the facts. :D",0

Josey Wales,"Thank you for all the boringly predictable Millennial snowflake ❄️ responses 😎. The emasculation of men by the left is going great in America. <br><br>To the point, it’s not solely about “females”, it’s more about “...and then a miracle happened” character development (or serious lack thereof). The writers wanted to “force” (no pun intended😎) this unknown character into the story and it lacked a scintilla of credibility. <br><br>Furthermore, Hayden C as a 22-ish acting was often atrocious. But that is well-documented already. The script and dialog often suffered in this case and didn’t help but at least his Force-driven feats/exploits in the plot made sense<br><br>Last, Episode I, which advanced the backstory of a child Anakin, suffered from an even more ridiculous script plot-making a 9 yo (who looked 7) a genius inventor and engineer who, I guess, rebuilt the C3PO droid, etc. But, it had other redeeming qualities-giving insights into Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon canon, both acted well by heavyweights.",0

As for the people who thinks they&#39;re redoing Empire Strikes Back, watch the trailer again. As for The Force Awakens, yes it did have countless similarities to A New Hope, I admit that, but JJ Abrams has said countless times in countless interviews that that film was his tribute to one of the greatest film franchises of all time. And I have to tell you, he follows the vision of George Lucas big time and I thought the movie was impeccable, despite the similarities. I&#39;m going to give the new director Rian Johnson a chance and see this movie. And if you all are fans of this franchise, you would too.",1

Matthew LaRock,Rey is a reincarnation of Anakin. Luke wasn&#39;t afraid of Vader&#39;s power but should have been. Look at the flash back she had when she touched the light saber. Luke knew it and left her being afraid of what could come. Luke is a gray Jedi. Snoke is using kylo to get to Rey. Kylo will flip flop and Luke will play both sides. Luke fled because he knew he was turning and did not want people to suffer. He was going to secluded himself on the island to die there and also hoping Rey would never find out who she really is.,0

Evelien H,"<b>SPOILER ABOUT SNOKE BELOW</b> <br><br>Supreme leader Snoke is a powerful ancient sith lord that was entombed for unknown reasons (yet) during the Old Republic. He&#39;s come back, because something/someone/he himself released him after emperor Palpatine died. He feeds of the force/midichlorians (hence he looks better in the upcomming movie) to regain his power. If he&#39;d kill Luke he&#39;d be at his most powerful. Snoke is not Darth Plagueis as many people thought (the franchise confirmed this). Rey and possibly Kilo Ren will try to stop him from killing Luke.",1

PinkButterflyGaming,"I just noticed this... Kylo was in a black and white room. I noticed Kylo hit his helmet at the lights. (white) This is a representation of him trying to destroy the LIGHT side within him, since he did say, he felt the pull to the light side in the previous film. Although, it does seem to be not working since in the teaser, his helmet seemed to be DESTROYED, (You know, there was glass everywhere, and his helmet was smoking.) Hint of redemption? I don&#39;t know. Well, I think this is a representation that he cannot destroy the Light side, because if he does, he also starts not just destroying his past, but also makes him forget his family legacy, like Darth Vader, like you all said, that he is becoming more of his own person. It makes sense since he said during the scene &quot;Let the past die.&quot;, him destroying his past can just make him more attached to the light side, now that his helmet is destroyed, he is exposed to the light side.",0

Chris Gerard,"I think that Snoke and Rey definitely have a history of some sort. The &quot;raw, untamed power&quot; line is definitely referring to Rey. I think that Rey was a Padawan at Luke&#39;s Jedi academy and Snoke tapped into her mind like he did in The Force Awakens during her battle with Kyle Ren. I believe that he basically took control of Rey and used her strong powers to kill all of the other young Jedi in the academy (and she had no recollection because she was under Snoke&#39;s dark spell). After this happened, Rey was sent to Jakku, in the outer rim, to live in isolation where she would never be found again or discover her powers. I think that there is a force Nexxus surrounding Jakku, which would allow Rey to be undetected by any force user (an example would be Yoda hiding on Degobah which was surrounded by a force nexxus). In addition to everything else, this definitely justifies Luke&#39;s reaction... as he didn&#39;t fear her power enough back then but he definitely does now!!! This would explain everything and make the story tie in well together. I really hope that they took this route in The Last Jedi.",0

Christopher Russell,"I see 3 possible scenarios with the scene on Crait where Rey asks Ben Solo for help. Here goes: <b>SCENARIO 1: Rey is being seduced by the Dark Side.</b> In this scenario, Luke has become so discouraged, he could have given up training Rey, leaving her so frustrated that despite Ben&#39;s attack on Ahch-To, Rey feels that Ben could very well be the teacher he claimed Rey needed. That&#39;s Scenario #1. <b>SCENARIO 2: Rey is following Luke&#39;s orders.</b> This scenario is perhaps the most positive outlook for Luke. In this scenario, Luke is not as defeated as he seems, he still believes that there&#39;s good in the Force, just like he was right that there was good in his father, Anakin. It&#39;s possible Luke wants Rey to extract crucial info that Kylo Ren possesses, that could ultimately aid the Light Side and the Resistance. That&#39;s Scenario #2. NOW.... <b>SCENARIO 3*. &lt;pause&gt; This is the most depressing scenario of all: At this point in the story, *Luke Skywalker is dead (quite possibly, Snoke killed him).</b> The morale of the Resistance is at an all-time low. It&#39;s the big gloom... and Rey is so out of options while coping with Luke&#39;s death, she does the unthinkable - despite how much she hates Kylo Ren, he seeks him out and asks for his help, simply because he is the only Force-user left capable of helping Rey finish her training in the Force.",0

Jacob Angeles,"I was about to tear up when I saw our Princess, Carrie Fisher, as General Leia Organa.",0
Adam Ursell,"Rey is getting trained, there are plenty of clips to suggest so. Luke is not going to like Rey&#39;s plan, because obviously if he trains her she&#39;ll put her skills into practice in an endeavor against the Sith, ie first order, and he&#39;ll think it&#39;ll be pointless against a power like Snoke and that suggests that Rey is probably wanting to confront Kylo whom almost killed her companions. The confrontation may also be Rey, who has discovered that Leia is her Aunt or possibly even mother, and that Kylo may be her brother or at least she finds out he&#39;s her cousin, is wanting to talk to and or kill Kylo. I don&#39;t think that exchange in the trailer is the same scene, but I do think Kylo will be making a move towards helping the light side, specifically Rey, at some point near the end of the film.  It would be convenient for ending the franchise to either see all force users perish, or a truce between light side and dark side users. The obvious bridge would be the complex family ties of Kylo and Ren, as Kylo obviously struggles with killing his family members which suggests inner turmoil and a conscience, making a change of heart within him more likely. Furthermore, Kylo said in  memory of his grandfather Anakin &quot;I will finish, what you started&quot;, which could allude to the prophecy and purpose of Anakin to bring balance to the force. Anakin was a complex character as he started off good, became very evil, then changed back to good again at indeed the most crucial moment he could, close to emperor Palpatine enabling him to kill him. This could mean that Kylo has long been plotting to get close to Snoke, doing things like slaying his parents to prove his devotion and loyalty, though it may be hard for him. Snoke I believe is talking about Rey&#39;s power, as Luke looks frightened of it himself and as Rey seems to be being force tortured at the end of the trailer, presumably after being captured either by Kylo or more probably Snoke which is why he says the line. Snoke would want to convert her if possible as the dark side is all about that power. Fin was infiltrating the first order for some reason which suggests that he goes to rescue her after finding out she is in trouble. That could be who Luke is speaking to when he says &quot;this isnt going to go the way you think&quot;, a Finn who has come looking for her, so we may see Luke training Finn also.",0

OssianPosse,It’s a trailer meant to lead us astray and nothing will turn out like it appears. My take: “When I first found you” is probably said to Rey and not Kylo. Kylo will not kill Leia. In the end scene Ray is talking to Luke and not Kylo (meaning Kylo is reaching out to someone else). Rey will not turn evil. Luke might die and Rey is indeed his daughter.,0

StopMinecraftVIOLENCE,"Okay so, seems like an improvement over the train wreck that was The Force Awakens, but again The Last Jedi seems highly derivative of its original trilogy counterpart in The Empire Strikes Back (training montage with jaded master, generic ice planet battle, AT-ATs).<br><br>Visually it looks way more sophisticated and stylish than TFA, which was typically inventive as per JJ Abrams&#39; imagination which is limited mostly to flashy lights and explosions.<br><br>Some seriously corny dialogue has been shown off in the trailer which is another bad sign, but then again the director seemed to be making out that it was a bad representation of the final product so we&#39;ll see.<br><br>I&#39;m really really hoping that this won&#39;t be as awful as TFA.

JC,"The story seems like a classic storytelling, with multiple themes. See if u can pick up the themes reflected from other films. <br> (Mindful of the assumptions) this is how SW8 could go down... <br><br>1. Ben is &quot; the spark &quot; from the Skywalker bloodline,  that &quot;Light(s) up the First order, turning back to the light side after Rey sacrifices herself (just like Ben&#39;s motherand father) for him to be fully redemped, jjust like Luke did for Anakin. However, Ben here may lose a limb... or two... <br><br>2. However Rey, in this case is from the Palpatine bloodline, which to fulfill &quot;her destiny&quot; could be coerced (not tempted like in Ben&#39;s case to the dark side) by Snoke through directly forcing the Dark side energy into her. A different transition in her case.<br><br>4. What&#39;s interesting is Luke also gets to study the dark side from &quot;ancient&quot; Jedi teachings at the 1st temple&quot; and possibly learns that to dismantle the First order from the inside &quot;like Anakin did with the Jedi, from the inside&quot;, is to allow Rey to be the apprentice and ironically betray the &quot;emperor&quot; just like Anakin did, possibly this time using both light and dark side power.<br><br>5. It is very possible that Luke also turns as a gray Jedi,  and unfortunately Rey has to sacrifice Luke for her to &quot;fulfill her destiny&quot; . So Ben will be the last Jedi<br>and Rey to the Sith... under the rule of two, &quot;Bringing balance to the force&quot; as Yoda puts it.<br><br> May not be completely accurate, but seems it&#39;s going in this direction. Comments welcome. Thanks",0

Whats bugging me is that line about how  he has seen this raw strength only once before and it didn&#39;t scare him enough then, but it does now - Just my shot in the dark but I think he isnt referring to Kylo Ren but rather his father Darth Vader. He was scared of Vader and his power to a point. I know that I&#39;m most like wrong knowing the SW universe, but just a thought that popped into my head.",0

And what are you talking about? There are no Jedi left!&quot;<br>Rey: &quot;From my point of view the Jedi are evil!&quot;<br><br>(Luke gets confused and says &quot;what?&quot; in his head) <br><br>Luke: &quot;Then you are lost!&quot;<br><br>(Rey and Luke stare at each other for a sec)<br><br>Rey: &quot;This is the end for you my master.&quot;<br><br>(Rey jumps of her platforms onto Luke&#39;s and they continue fighting for a minute until Luke does a back flip off the platform onto the black sandy edge of the lava river.)<br> <br>Luke: &quot;It&#39;s over, Rey. I have the high ground.&quot;<br>Rey: &quot;You underestimate my <b>POWER!</b> &quot;<br>Luke: &quot; <b>Don&#39;t try it.</b> &quot;<br><br>(Rey jumps towards Luke and Luke cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. Rey tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava. Rey struggles to pull herself up the embankment with her hand. She keeps sliding down in the black sand.)<br><br>Luke: &quot;I trusted you! You said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them! It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness!&quot;<br><br>(Luke picks up Rey&#39;s light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.)<br><br>Rey: &quot;I hate you!&quot;<br>Luke: &quot; You were my apprentice, Rey. I loved you.&quot;<br><br>(Rey&#39;s clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly Rey bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.<br>Luke looks in horror as Rey becomes engulfed in flames. Luke can&#39;t watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames. He runs back to Finn&#39;s ship as Rey drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.)<br><br>THE END. :)",45

arya tawde,"What if when Luke says he&#39;s seen this power before he&#39;s talking not of Kylo but if himself.... say kylo attacks him and his disciples and Luke in anger loses control over his force powers (which we know are supposed to be incredible) and accidentally causes the deaths of his other disciples. Fearing his own power he retreats trying to find the old Jedi temples to learn where he went wrong, a far more possible theory than Kylo defeating him as the trailer seems to suggest?",0

StevenGamesHD,"Similarities:<br><br>1. In episode 5, we see luke skywalker go to dagobah to train with yoda. Here in the last jedi, (keep in mind this is the 2nd movie in the sequel trilogy) rey goes to the island to train with luke. <br><br>In episode 4, darth vader tried to kill luke cuz luke was gonna blow up the death star. Here in the last jedi, u can see kylo trying to kill leia. All these people are related to each other.<br><br>Basically what I&#39;m saying is that i feel like the sequel trilogy is just a remake of the original trilogy, like how the force awakens is very similar to a new hope. This is my opinion.<br><br>But im still gonna watch it, I love star wars.",0
The Sexy Skywalker,"Star Wars is a timeless masterpiece which will continue to inspire and fulfill hearts for many generations to come. The core story is not affected by the fact that it was created in the 1970s,  right now 2017, so what difference will it make like in 2100? I wonder in the next century what the Star Wars movies will look like and be about. Just seeing this trailer brought a tear in my eye. :&#39;)",0

Kudu Doodoo,"snoke is an ancient force being, imprisoned for thousands of years, and woken by order 66. he feeds off of the force energy of the jedi to restore his physical form. Thats why luke is hiding, and thats why rey is floating at the end of the trailer. snoke is using kylo ren to make him more powerful, and then to take his force powers as well. got all this from a theorizer with a source inside disney. Also rey is probably very old as well, as she says, then she is awake. i think rey may have been the one who imprisoned snoke",1

Joey Horist,"I have a new Rey origins theory. It gets complicated so pay attention. It is a mix of various other theories floating around. Maybe Rey has lineage of many major characters. Maybe Anakin had a secret sibling conceived by Qui-Gon Jinn &amp; Shmi Skywalker who went on to hook up with a child fathered by Palpatine who then went on to hook up with a Kenobi descendant. Convoluted and improbable yes, but who knows. We shall see! We know most of these characters were prone to flout the statutes of their respective Jedi/Sith lifestyles. That would explain what Luke means in the trailer when he says he has never seen power like Rey&#39;s before. She is so powerful because she descends from so many powerful ancestors.",0

Caprioly,"So Luke starts to teach Rey. Luke realizes how powerfull Rey is. It reminds him to Ben Solo so much that he is convinced that Rey is also going to be just another threat to the galaxy and to the balance of the Force as Ben is. He either tells Rey to leave and never return, or attacks her, trying to kill her before she becomes the very thing Luke is very scared off. Rey either leaves or escapes dissappointed in Luke Skywalker. She does not find her in the galaxy, so she turns to Ben for guidance who accepts her as an apprentice. Together they try to defeat Snoke but they fail. Snoke destroys Lukes lightsaber, disarms Rey and cripples Ben. They can barely escape with the help of Chewacca and FN2187. The movie ends with all of them in a medical facality, trying to decide how to continue.",0

I want a twist that defeats empire strikes back. I dont want a “i am your father” I WANT SOMETHING THAT PUSHES THE VERY FABRIC OF THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE.

Master Yoda,"I think that Rey is gonna be pushed by Snoke to the dark side at the end of the movie. Luke will try to teach her before that but he will fail, she will be too powerfull and that one more thing which scared Luke is perhaps a key for Snoke when hes saying in the trailer &quot;beyond that, something truly special&quot;. I believe that Snoke is speaking to Rey, not Kylo at that moment. Half trained Rey gonna sense that her friends are in trouble, she will fly to rescue them but will fail and Snoke will get her and turn to the dark side. Kylo on the other hand could become in this movie someone in the middle, &quot;balanced&quot;. He will not kill his mother, hes gonna be messed up inside his head whole movie ending between dark and light.",0

Watcher 693,"Source is the force. It&#39;s real They don&#39;t want any of us to tap into that fully. They know we are all capable of love vibrations. When you get that in you and you learn to harness it, they can&#39;t can&#39;t control. They know this about all of us and don&#39;t  want us to know. These movies are trying to sell on us that&#39;s it&#39;s elusive to special people. It&#39;s not. They buried it deep and it&#39;s a simple truth. Love and light inside you through mediation and activating the pineal gland and the medulla is very powerful for us. Everything is frequency and vibration. 528hz. Look into it and Tesla. Don&#39;t be deceived by dark Hollywood. They said it the first movie Disney made for Star Wars.  &quot;there has been an awakening &quot;. There has and the dark ones know this. <br>By the way Luke would never say something scared him. Fear is the dark side. &quot;Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to the dark side&quot;.  In life there are two main emotions. .......Love or fear.  If you are strong in love you fear nothing. It&#39;s that simple guys. Dark fears love.",0

Kian Rostami,"Man ! I’m so hyped right now. And as far as the story, Luke is referring to Kylo  Ren when he’s talking about raw strength cuz the scene after that is the Jedi temple burning and Luke buried since we all know who did that ! Basically, Luke refuses to train Rey when he sees her true power and capabilities. He doesn’t wanna mess things up again. As for Kylo Ren, i’m telling you guys ! This dude will return to the light side. The scene when he smashes his mask is him kinda questioning himself and his purpose. Rey is seeking for guidance cuz she still doesn’t know what she is ! My opinion ?!! She will certainly step into the dark side while Kylo steps back to the light side. Awesome job Disney !!",0

RR P,"Hello,<br>I think Snoke is the student, who betrayed Luke? He is like a big brother to Kylo, corrupted him and drew him to the darkside, because he is Vaders grandson... Snoke looks old because he was hurt in the fight against Lukes &quot;good&quot; students - like Palpatine in the fight with Mace Windu. Rey is the daughter of Leia, but has no father - like Anakin. She hid her from the Snoke, so that he could not take her other child to. She got pregnant after Han left, so he didn&#39;t know it. Look is scared, because Rey is as strong as Snoke.<br>Kylo cannot kill his mother; so Snoke kills her and drops Kylo. Then he leads Rey to the books, that showed him the dark side; and so she turns against Luke. Kylo flees from the first order to his uncle and both unite to fight Rey and Snoke. Could this be?",0

Mortanos,"No, no and NO ! as if the last SW movie had not shattered enough that true SW hold dear, I now see this trailer and know now that SW is well and truly dead. Jar Jar Abrams ( may he fall into a Sarlacc pit ) proved he is a Trekkie, but should have no right to ever touch SW again. However good ole Disney wont care about quality, its quantity they want. All they can see are Dollar Bills, and the newer SW generation is too misguided to know the difference between a good story and a money making scheme of sequel upon sequel. ............once upon a time Star Wars was special.",4

Ramza1890 p,I think that Luke will still be considered the one to have brought balance to the force by the end of the series. I believe that Kylo&#39;s and Rey&#39;s power levels are on par with each other and by the end of this trilogy they will be the only two force users left alive. Luke training both of them will be his part in bringing balance. Hopefully Kylo will have a better handle on his emotions by then.,0

mnbr,I wish they had picked someone else to play Rey.,0
Berry Banana,HYPED!!!,0
nawaalii,"Kylo offering his hand to Rey is basically the same scene as when Darth Vader did to Luke, I guess this means that Rey will get her hand cut off by kylo when she refuses and then on the next movie Kylo will help Rey at the end kill Snoke by throwing him in a pit and then kylo dies from force related injuries.

Information On Certain Objects,"An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.<br><br>Incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltageratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent lamp is widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.<br><br>Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light,[1] with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%.[2]The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps.[3] Some applications of the incandescent bulb (such as heat lamps) deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry,[4] heat lights for reptile tanks,[5] infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.<br><br>Incandescent bulbs have been replaced in many applications by other types of electric light, such as fluorescent lamps, compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL), high-intensity discharge lamps, and light-emitting diode lamps (LED). Some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, China, Canada and United States, are in the process of phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs while others, including Colombia,[6] Mexico, Cuba, Argentina and Brazil,[7] have prohibited them already.",0

David Gallagher,I keep thinking that the shot with the someone wearing the Vader Helmet and the hand reaching down for the black light saber will be the last 5 minutes of the movie and its Rey not Kylo going dark side. I mean this is a 3 film arc to get to the Grey Jedi&#39;s. Would make sense with Kylo going light and Rey dark. Just a thought.,0

Finn is ok can’t wait to see where he goes, and just because Rey didn’t have as hard as a time as Luke doesn’t mean she’s a Mary Sue. Plus, her story is just beginning.",0

Luke P,"My theory: Luke stops training Rey because he sees she is too powerful and not in complete control. She will then eventually be turned to the dark side by Snoke because of being abandoned again, and having her will broken by Snoke.Kylo will switch to Luke’s side to help him defeat Snoke and try and bring Rey back to the light. I believe Kylo is talking to Luke when he says “you have to kill the past to become what you are meant to be”-aka forget that you screwed up with trying to train new Jedi and it ended in death, become the Jedi you are and let’s kill Snoke and save Rey.",104

I hate daisy’s character being amazing at everything, and I expected Finn to be the main protagonist (because the trailers for TFA made it seem so) and his character was better written. And I hate what they did to Luke no longer being the most powerful force user, overall Disney ruined Star Wars for me and some of the hardcore fans(who actually look at more than just the movies).",0

Mark Negron,"Unlike The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi looks like it takes only SOME beats from Empire, instead of pretty much remaking A New Hope, making this look more like it pays tribute to the best Star Wars movie while also furthering the new trilogy&#39;s own story. Examples of the paying tribute are seen in the space battle, the battle with the AT-AT looking mechs, and the new student training with a wise mentor who&#39;s fought in the ways of the Force and has been seen before if you watch these films in the numbered order. Examples of the originality show in the Finn v Phasma fight, Ben wanting to show remorse before he either kills Leia or at least tries to, and the more shadowy, sinister villain being much more active. Sidious just kinda spun around in his chair in Empire lol. I want this film to be the next greatest Star Wars films, but I&#39;m not sure, the last middle film in a Star Wars trilogy was Attack of the Clones soooo. Cautiously, but extremely, optimistic.",0
Art 'Burbs,"This is so boring. Disney milking the franchise and people still buying it. SW is youtube money making all over the place. New Blade Runner is great example you can expand and make quality work, but not for money, that&#39;s different. You know, you can&#39;t please everybody, but most, Disney can. Not me, though. Won&#39;t be seeing this in cinema.",14
NEPTUNUS BLACK,<b>O Filme Vai ser Ótimo!</b>,1
George Morley,I just don’t feel very excited about this. It looks overblown. I will wait and see but I think these films have lost the narrative power that make the original trilogy the classics that they are. Maybe I’m just turning into a curmudgeon but I don’t really feel emotionally invested in the saga anymore.,0

Richard Vandermeer,"In the teaser Luke says, &quot;It&#39;s time for the Jedi to end&quot;. Like the conflict that religion perpetuates on earth, Luke realises that there will never be peace while the Jedi and Sith exist. I think Rey and Kylo form an alliance (perhaps only after after Kylo learns he is being used and betrayed by Snoke). They combine the Dark and the Light and they bring balance to the universe by destroying the bonds of the Jedi and the Sith.",1

Lux,"Snoke is actually Mace Windu. When Anakin pushed him out of the window, he survived. He later sought vengeance after being betrayed by Anakin. The hatred that Mace Windu felt inevitably led him to the dark side, which fast forward to now, you can clearly see him much older. But along his path, much like Michael Jackson, Mace Windu changed his appearance and skin color, and changed his name to Snoke. Stay woke y&#39;all this is crazy I can&#39;t believe Disney made this cannon.<br><br><br><br><br>EDIT: I shouldn&#39;t have to say this, but for those who aren&#39;t that bright, OF COURSE this is a joke.

lostboynotfound,"<b>During Jedi training, Rey shows incredible strength and power with the force, Luke then is frightened by her incredible raw power with the force because in his life, he has only seen that once before, in KYLO REN when he was training to become a Jedi. Luke then cancels Rey&#39;s Jedi training in fears that she will destroy everything once again like Kylo Ren did and go to the dark side. So Luke then feels obligated to cancel her Jedi training, in hopes that she&#39;ll never be powerful enough to go to the dark side, like his previous apprentice Kylo Ren.</b>",0

Dispite their problems, episodes 1-3 was actually going somewhere, and filling the enormous amount of plot holes from the original trilogy. Ep 7 did the death star again, with a similar weakness. Killed an old friend like obiwan, has a villain who wad meanted to be good again. Now we have a remake of the training scene from yoda and luke, the same dilema of passing or not to the dark side.

1 Survivor,Is Kylo going to kill Leia just like Han??? :( That&#39;s the feeling I got watching this.<br><br>- Kylo gets even darker<br>- Luke is powerful as all hell but is troubled/conflicted by the past<br>- Finn gets captured by the first order or gets himself &quot;captured&quot; as part of a mission<br>- Snoke&#39;s body is weak but he&#39;s incredibly powerful <br>- Kylo probably captures Rey after a fight and takes her to Snoke<br>- Snoke probably reveals her origins to her/the fans,0

John DeWitt,"Remember the Force Awakens trailer? It made the movie look a certain way to throw us off. The end of this trailer, where Rey is supposedly talking to Kylo and he extends his hand, those are two different scenes. Kylo looks like he just got done fighting. She looks like she is having a fire side chat with Luke or something to that effect viewing her calm demeanor. Her face isn&#39;t sweaty or dirty from fighting. There aren&#39;t any embers or fire falling as well, like there are when it shows Kylo extends his hand.....hmmmm.",0

Voltz,"I am a deaf man but I haven&#39;t always been deaf you see. I was born with a crappy condition called Mineres Disease and after 24 years of my life battling it, I lost my hearing to it about 4 years ago.. I may be deaf today, but I&#39;ll never EVER forgot the them to Star Wars.. As I watched this trailer, I got a sense of the sounds in my head and when it got to the end, I felt like I could hear again and it felt so magical! I had goosebumps all over me.. I know I&#39;ll never hear again in my life but when this movie comes out on December 15, I&#39;m going to go to the movie theater and I&#39;m going to buy myself a ticket and I&#39;m going to watch this amazing movie, with my head held high.. Regardless if it has subtitles or not at the theater, you can count me in to be there because I will NOT let my deafness hold me back from living my life ANYMORE!!",375

Max Kirchi 🔱🌊,"I have an realy good idea for the plot of Episode VIII:<br><br>At first, Luke and Rey are trained by him. In these scenes, there is a scene that recalls Episode V (Darth Vader and Luke on Dagobah). Parallel to this, Kylo arrives at Snoke and will complete his education. From there, there is no Knight of Ren. They fly to the planet, where Luke and Rey are, and they are supposed to be eleven. Luke and Rey can escape while the old relics burst into flames. Later, Luke, Rey, and Chewie split up with Pork from each other. There comes the story section where Fin awakens and goes along with Leia on a mission to Cantobyte. Fin is captured, but Leia can flee to Kylo with her fleet. The Knights of Ren are supposed to eliminate Leia, but Kylo faces them and &quot;destroys his past.&quot; In these scenes, the scene with Kylo in the plane, but he does not destroy the fleet of resistance but his former friends.<br>Fin free and flies towards the planet with red earth. There will come to the showdown, between Fin and Phasma. Where won this figth, lives in Episode 9.<br>This is where Rey will be on the way to the ship of Snoke to defeat him as she thinks she&#39;s ready, but she is not. As Luke knows, he flies with Leia and Ben after her. There comes to the final fight between Luke, Rey, Ben and Leia against Snoke, the Knights of Ren and DJ the character was played from Beniccio del Torr.<br>But before the fight begins, Poe and Laura Dern take the attack on First Order.<br>After this fight, then the attention swings back to the rest and in this fight, Leia dies and Luke is seriously injured and returns to the planet from the beginning. Ben, ​​who is with Rey the last hope of the Resistance, then offers Rey a place at his side to finish her education (scene from the end of the trailer). After that, they are the only remaining gray Jedi and take the attack against First Order in episode 9.<br><br>Sorry for my bad english, but im from german.",14

What Sub🌟,"My current theory: Luke initially doesn&#39;t want to train Rey. He&#39;s wary of her power, afraid to fail again, believing the time of the Jedi is over. Rey shows that she&#39;s disciplined and headstrong and refuses to take no for an answer. Luke eventually relents and trains her. During this, The First Order moves against the Resistance, Rey senses it and wants to help. She leaves the training early. During the battle, Kylo is about to destroy the ship his Mother is on and has second guesses and the light wins. Rey finds herself confronting Snoke, Kylo betrays snoke to save Rey. Luke decides to not sit on the sidelines anymore and shows up to save Rey. Then we get an epic showdown between snoke and luke.",3

Her mentor cautions against this, but despite his warnings she confronts her enemy and is offered a choice to side with him after she learns of their blood relation.<br><br>At this point the resemblance between the new and old trilogy better serve some actual narrative or philosophical point because I&#39;m not sure why I would want to watch The Empire Strikes Back 2.",0

You know that during the old republic we thought we could foresee the things the Sith wanted to do.people thought you needed midichlorians to have the force, today we know  this is not true.<br>Rey: I understand<br><br>...something like this would correct a part of the Saga :D",0

flavio solari,"What I think it&#39;ll happen: 1- We all know Carrie is gone, so no doubt about the fate of her character. 2- Rey is going to trick Kylo into thinking that she&#39;s into the dark side but that&#39;s going to be just a double-cross to get close to Snoke and try to kill him (the plan will fail). Poe and Finn will be the side characters everybody will need to escape/create a  diversion. 3- Cute little puppy with Chewe to make us all go &quot;ooohhhh&quot;  4- Bland remake of the 5th episode as we all know 5-Hamill (as much as i admire the guy) I&#39;m afraid that his Luke in this new saga is going to be just a Joke....",0

Donald Baker,"The final trailer for &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; was brilliantly done but the film itself failed to live up to the trailer&#39;s expectations.  The trailer for &quot;Rogue One&quot; was also pretty good but some pivotal shots were not in the film itself.  So now this trailer.  It looks fantastic but I am not allowing myself to have ANY expectations whatsoever.  And with next year&#39;s Han Solo film directed by one of Hollywood&#39;s most mainstream directors (not meant to offend anyone; I just do not like Howard&#39;s film and I cannot be convinced otherwise), I just hope Disney does not oversaturate the public with Star Wars this and Stars Wars that.  I think that&#39;s how Paramount destroyed the Star Trek franchise in the 2000s.",0

These are Force Users who don’t identify necessarily with the neither the Sith nor the Jedi and it’s the same as the light and dark side.

Richie Gross,"I think there are a lot of red herrings in this trailer, and that makes it perfect.  It does exactly what a trailer should do, gets us excited for the film, evokes some of the tones and themes of the film, and ultimately tells us nothing or very little about the plot.  I don&#39;t think Luke is going to abandon Rey&#39;s training (partly for fear of what her strength could do if she isn&#39;t well guided), I doubt Kylo kills Leia, and I&#39;ll be extremely surprised if Rey joins Kylo (that was definitely not the same scene).",0

Jan Bruger,"[Potential Spoiler] Ben will not kill Leia, but the First order will. This will bring Ben back to the good side, while Rey, pushed away by Luke, is drawn to the dark side and tutelage of Snoke. Thus, Ben and Rey effectively switch places. I hypothesize the Grand Finale of Episode IX (or maybe even of Ep. VIII?) will be: Luke and Ben duel Snoke and Rey. Snoke kills Luke before Reys eyes. This makes Rey realize she loved Luke (her father, uncle, mentor, whatever) all along and that she belongs on the good side. Together, Ben and Rey take on Snoke. They manage to defeat him, but Ben dies in the fight. In the End, Rey is the only trained force user left in the galaxy, establishing a new order of the Jedi or going into Exile, effectively becoming similar to Luke after Ep. VI.",43

Hunter Parker,"New theory:<br><br>Ren and Rey are the Son and Daughter of the Force. The Son managed to kill his Father (like Kylo), but was still trapped on Mortis by Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Ahsoka. Since he knew that the Chosen One, Anakin, could control Him, he had to wait until Anakin was dead before he could inhabit the Universe, which he did in the form of a child being born almost right after the Chosen One died. The sister, after realizing what her brother had done, followed him into the material Universe and manifested herself as Rey. Since they are humans now, and not yet Force wielders like they were, they don’t know their history and their past, but as they continue to learn, they will discover themselves and fight to retain balance in the Force.",0

Brandon,The moment you realize you are excited about Star Wars only to realize something does not feel right. I thought this idea of direction from Rian Johnson was scetchy from the get go. I feel like they have taken everything Star Wars was and flipped it upside down. I get that Star Wars originally had a darker ending and this is making up for it. That does not excuse changing a whole concept to appeal to the new audience. They waited too long to do that. Now we have this idea which will turn into the most controversial Star Wars film. Changing everything and starting something new with one story left. I have a bad feeling with this movie. I do not think anything Rian has done will change my mind. Chances are I am going to hate this episode for the first and last time in my life. How to ruin Star Wars? You are watching it rn...,0

Then they could of added some drama where Kylo gets torn between the love of his mother and the first order cause. Could of made the audience start to anticipate what would be Kylo Ren&#39;s next actions in the movie. Would he turn against the first order? Or would he stay firm and move forward losing the last loved one he had? You see these are things good writers do in stories to keep their audience wanting to see what will happen next.",0

Says, HE made that same mistake when HE was at her stage of training and lost his HAND, and says it&#39;s NOT going to go the WAY you THINK! and Snoke is the one wrenching her back neck first with her screaming JUST as Vader had Luke positioned when he TOOK his hand.",0

Beren TheBear,A good sci fi story is suppose to immerse the person into the story. There is a level of believability a writer needs to keep their audience. It is a sad day when writers fail to do this and get away with it. Look back at the original movies they never lose the audience&#39;s believabilty which is why they were so great. The chances of Kylo Ren being directly responsible for killing both his parents at a different time and place is near impossible to ever occur. I guess amateur writers can get away with anything now. I guess having bad writers who only push politically correct agendas is more important than an actual good story that keeps inteligent people interested without coming off fake and cheesy.,0

NinjadoGames,"Okay how is this similar to Episode 5? When did The Empire Strikes back show us a giant battle between 2 fleets, the wise old master being scared of their student. (Pretty sure Yoda wasn&#39;t scared of the power Luke had). I also don&#39;t see any signs of the Rebels evacuating their hidden base it looks like they are defending it as where in Episode 5 they were slowing down the attack to retreat and escape. I also don&#39;t see a Bespin in this movie at all or a Lando along with captured heroes being held for ransom. Yes parts of the movie are inspired which was common even in the prequels. However there is enough original content to deem this it&#39;s own thing.",5

A lot of AT-AT in a planet attacking the &quot;not the rebels&quot;, the &quot;not the empire&quot; attacking the good guys fleet and then they all escape just to fall into &quot;Not the empire&quot; hands again, then the &quot;not yet jedi girl&quot; comes to the rescue, she fights the sith lord in black armor and cape, he defeats her and tells her something surprising and the she escapes (maybe losing a hand in the process) and probably one of their friends is captured. <br><br>Oh man, I really want to see the &quot;not the ewoks&quot; in the next movie.",97

The explanation of the previous film was so flimsy, so illogical, it&#39;s just tape over this mess. Kylo kills his father in a heartbeat but cries when killing his mom? It all is suspended, nothing settles down nicely. Everything we&#39;ve been fighting for is gone. Nothing has changed and we are watching similar things from the beginning.

Will Davey,Really can&#39;t figure out the plot,0
Blacknet,Rey = Luke<br>Kylo = Vader<br>Snoke = Emperor<br>Luke = Yoda<br>Finn = Chewbacca?<br>Poe (the pilot) = Han Solo<br>Ep. 7 story = Ep. 4 story<br>And now we have: A battle on a frozen planet + Rey (Luke) training with Luke (Yoda) in some sh**hole + Kylo (Vader) trying to get Rey (Luke) on the dark side. So probably Ep. 8 story = Ep. 5 story. Dunno what people like so much about these new episodes when there&#39;s nothing new except visuals.,148

Giorgi Nemsitsveridze,"Here to say that Star Wars universe depresses me as it continues with it&#39;s vast number of new, unnecessary creatures to make it more colorful and the technology that is used like toys and two dimensional characters. Lack of realistic feel of it&#39;s scenes... Even though some sci-fi and fantasy movies are far from our real world, there are some (even TV series) that you can relate to and are far more organic than Star Wars, It&#39;s 2017 and the original movies are still better than the new ones, not just story wise but in a way the universe and characters are depicted.<br>I&#39;m writing all that not because I hate on this universe, but because I always genuinely wanted to get more from SW franchise than laser shooting and ominous voices, high stakes that don&#39;t have any pay offs.<br>I&#39;d want more grounded, believable and relatable stories and characters.

It would make perfect sense if Rey and Kylo were related to Bastila and Revan, Kylo wears a mask similar to Revan, Rey&#39;s hair is similar to Bastila&#39;s. It would tie everything together perfectly, saying the Skywalkers are actually related to Revan. Also if Rey turns to the dark side, she&#39;s giving into the temptation that Luke didn&#39;t, so it wouldn&#39;t be the same as Empire in that respect. Empire didn&#39;t have a casino planet or porgs either. I suppose i&#39;m supposed to think that canto bright is instead of Bespin, and Rey will try to rescue her friends just as Luke did.",0

Ryan Russell,Luke was approaching the pinnacle of power. But emotions and vengeance were in play. What happens next in the chain complete annihilation of universe what vader tried to get luke to do. Rey probably has 10x the power of vader and luke fears this because power draws people to the dark side.The moment rey awakens the force in this preview i bet during the movie vader senses it and react. By now everyone knows its either join or die if the dark side wants you so it will be an all out war to obtain rey but little do they know she can destroy an entire fleet from a galaxy away just my thought =P,0

But who cares, it doesn&#39;t make the film experience any different.<br><br>Kylo saying kill to become what you were meant to be is definitely to Rey, I&#39;m sure their Empire scene will be her losing to him maybe an arm before or after the Snoke torture, or him saving her from Snoke and them getting together.<br><br>I think Luke saying this isn&#39;t going to go the way you think will be him being Yoda when he told him not to go to Bespin to save his friends when she wants to do the same thing for Finn haha, and he&#39;s like dude..been there, didn&#39;t go well, i should have listened, and they have a little scuffle",0

So while maybe Kylo is holding out his hand to Rey, i don&#39;t think its in the context this trailer portrays.",0

Jack,So Zach Galifianakis plays Luke now?,10
The Mighty Pringles,"I&#39;m beginning to think that Rey may be possessed by a dark side figure, and i&#39;m leaning towards Palpatine. I believe that Snoke&#39;s (I think its Snoke) monologue at the start is not to Kylo Ren, and they have put footage of Kylo there to put us off track and because it makes sense that Snoke might be saying that to Kylo. But it is in fact to Rey, and when he says &quot;And beyond that, something truely special&quot; unless they are looking for the largest anti-climax ever, its not her force power, its that she has somebody inside her, possessing her. Luke mentions that he saw this strength once before, and he wasn&#39;t scared enough then but is now. It makes sense that he is referencing the ending confrontation of EP. VI. Luke clearly was not scared up until the very end because he had Vader by his side, but now, there is a fresh new body that he can take control of and Luke is scared by this prospect.  Rey also comments that there had always been something inside of her and it had just awoken. This also makes sense because if Palpatine had indeed possessed her, there would be no reason to take over her conciousness in the middle of a desert, however, when he saw Luke, who caused his downfall he got awoken through pure rage, which is why Rey comments that it what was inside her has awoken. <br>What do you guys thinko?<br>Also, Can someone explain to me what  Kylo says in this trailer? I didnt understand much of it.",2

The RASTA LOUNGE,Here&#39;s my conclusion Luke gives in to his fear seeing Reys true power and goes rogue and gives in to the dark side. Rey turns to Kylo Ren  for help to take down Snoke and Luke.,0
OrangeRangerVideos,"Okay, I know I speak for all fans of Star Wars when I see the scene with Leia is a stab in the feels, for obvious reasons.<br><br>Hidden thing I think is interesting: Luke said that he&#39;s only seen the kind of power Rey has once before, and it scares him now.  But fear is the path to the Dark Side...&quot;fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering&quot;.  So Luke isn&#39;t purely on the Jedi path...if he ever was to begin with.",0

Matias Flores,"I must say, there are some very nice shots in the trailer, much more interesting visually than TFA.",0
Vaugn Ripen,"Rey and Kylo are brother and sister. They borrowed from one of the books storylines.  Luke says he&#39;s only seen this power once before and in essence he didn&#39;t respect it. And he&#39;s not referring to Kylo. He&#39;s speaking of Darth Vader. Remember, Luke was very calm facing Vader because he felt he could turn him, even though he knew his power.  By most accounts he should have been at least a little nervous. The Skywalker bloodline runs from the Princess to both Kylo and Rey...I just can&#39;t figure out how they will explain Han and the Princess&#39;s lack of acknowledging Rey&#39;s absence all these years.",0
Pedro Caetano,"I just have this strong feeling Kylo Ren will redeem himself and join with Rey to fight Snoke in the end. First, long ago, they announced that Kylo would not be the villain of Ep. VIII, but Benicio Del Toro&#39;s character. Weird, right? Now he smashes his helmet for some reason and seems to be joining with Rey somehow. This may also explain why he still looks troubled (about which side of the Force to follow) in this trailer&#39;s scenes. Hope I help raise some theories.",0
Mark Thompson,Sad how star wars has become a bastardization of a weak culture.,1
Monica Malk,I hope Rey will die. It would be unexpected.,1
Julia Kiwior,❤❤❤ YES!!! I LOVE IT❤ MY 🌍,1
O.G. Starwars,"Well they didn&#39;t show the casino planet, DJ, or other details. Notice Rey&#39;s clothing in the scenes, may tell you more then you expect. I think Kylo is upset with the truth about his grandfather and so he throws his helmet down. Or he truly doesn&#39;t want to be in the dark side anymore. I don&#39;t think Kylo will kill his mom. They have a force bond. I think the crack in the scene could be from the sea creature. I think Luke was talking about either Vader or sidious about seeing raw power. But I can also be yoda? Luke had that raw power and so did his dad. Also Luke trains Rey or we wouldn&#39;t get the saber scenes. I would like to think Luke isn&#39;t scared or a wimp and he is still the most powerful Jedi/force user EVER. And maybe the raw power talk he speaks of is himself? Hmmmm...so as to Snoke being so afraid of Luke and speaking of if Luke returns so will the NEW JEDI. I also think Luke saying it&#39;s not going to go as you think could be said to Kylo or maybe Leia? <br>This trailer isn&#39;t in full chronological order. <br>But one thing I disagree about is how they are portraying Luke.",0

suddenlycryptid,"So I&#39;ve seen countless theories for this movie and the future of this series and I&#39;m definitely thinking that this trailer is proving the biggest one. Spoilers for the theory below<br><br>[spoiler]So the theory that I&#39;ve been spitballing with my friends and seen floating around various media is that <i>Luke</i> is the last jedi, not Rey. This trailer is proving it - because Luke tells Rey that the strength he sees from her is what scares him. He&#39;s only seen it once before - cut to scenes from his temple/academy being destoryed. <br><br>Theory: Luke&#39;s going to turn away Rey. Rey turns to someone at the end. Possibly Kylo Ren. Kylo, who is <i>not</i> a sith, but a [b]dark force user[/b] as has been stressed by various expanded universe books and stories. <br><br>Why is this important? <i>Because Kylo and Rey are going to become</i> <b>grey jedi</b> .<br><br>What&#39;s a grey jedi? It&#39;s a jedi who uses both sides of the force to maintain balance. <br><br>From Wookiepedia:<br><br><i>There must be both dark and light. I will do what I must to keep the balance, as the balance is what holds all life. There is no good without evil, but evil must not be allowed to flourish. There is passion, yet peace; serenity, yet emotion; chaos, yet order. I am a wielder of the flame; a champion of balance. I am a guardian of life. I am a Gray Jedi.</i><br><br>Another big theory: Kylo Ren is going to step away from Lord Snoke and go off with Rey. The two are going to either join the Resistance, or they&#39;re going to have their own outside faction. <br><br>Kylo has time and time again been conflicted as to his actions and to which side he actually belongs to. As witnessed to how he broke down in front of Han before ultimately sacrificing his father. As witnessed again when he could have killed Leia, but he hesitates in this trailer. <br><br>I realize no one is probably going to read this, but I <i>had</i> to get my ranting out.[/spoiler]",1

Imagine if he just pulls it and kills her and it was basically revealed in the trailer... yeah. That&#39;s like if the first trailer  of the Force Awakens showed Kylo about to ignite the lightsaber before he <b>spoiler</b> killed Deckard.<br><br>I bet Rei and Kylo end up teaming up and becoming more middling &#39;jedi&#39; vs good or evil and take down snoke in the next movie.",0

When Kylo was trying to get in her head, she overpowered him, sayin he was afraid he&#39;d never be as powerful as Darth Vader...

Figrin Dan,"What I got from this trailer and the 1st one  and what might happen.<br>If any of this comes true that would be awesome.<br>May be spoilers here.<br><br>1. Leia is leading the retreat/evacuation from the Resistance secret base which isn&#39;t a secret any more, the the 1st Order fleet attack. Kylo has the chance to hit the Resistance Command Ship&#39;s bridge but doesn&#39;t fire and Leia lives or he does fire and kills  Leia.<br>2. Snoke is talking to Kylo and Snoke rips into Kylo for not being strong enough still.<br>Kylo gets a replacement Cross Guard Saber and another helmet. <br>Kylo then talks to Vader, goes to his room and smashes his helmet, leaving it broken and smoking on the floor.<br>3. Rey gives the Skywalker Saber to Luke. Luke talks to Rey and begins her training. Rey goes into the Force Tree/Jedi Temple and has a new vision, from the past. Luke was in the fire that killed his Jedi Knights and he had to climb out of the burning rubble, then he falls to his knees in defeat and puts his hand or R2.<br>Rey falls to the ground with one hand out stretched, she then makes the pebbles rise.<br>4. After more training, Rey swimming to get something then Luke with Rey, Chewie, R2 and a Porg fly off in the Falcon to join the fighting.  <br>5. Poe has his ship blown up in the hanger so he gets into another x-Wing to lead a squad of X-Wings into battle but survives the conflict by jumping to Hyperspace and shows up later on Krayt leading Ski Speeders against the 1st Order Walkers.<br>6. Finn is in the hospital and wakes up as the 1st. Order attack. Finn meets a girl named Rose and they escape to the space casino where they discover DJ is being held so they dress up as 1st. Order troops and break DJ out but get betrayed later by DJ and Finn fights Phasma, cutting off her hand. DJ either dies or shows he is a good guy after all and helps Rose and Finn save the sister of Rose, Miss Paige.<br>7. Later, Rey and Luke fight Snoke&#39;s Elite Red Guards and win or lose and are taken to face Snoke. Or Snoke or Kylo captures Rey and Snoke uses the Dark Side to punish Rey. Kylo helps her get away or Rey says she will join Snoke. Luke gets captured or dies. <br>8. Kylo reaches out to Rey to join him as a good guy or bad guy.<br>9. Maybe Luke joins Snoke ?",2

Rey and Ben Solo are clearly in the same orange-lit place/area. so yeah thanks Disney you just gave away your &quot;twist.&quot; will never be as clever as &quot;I am your father.&quot; not even close haha.,0

Curtis DeSmith,"Okay so this is what I think -<br><br>In the beginning of the trailer when Luke talks to Rey and looks all frightened and says “the first time I saw this strength I was not frightened, but now I am,” he ends up turning Rey down and decides not to train her because he’s afraid of another Ren incident. Rey gets all edgy and decides to go independent for a while. Next when Kylo Ren looks like he is in his TIE Silencer and looks like he is about to shoot down Leia, but hesitates, he will turn away at the last second showing his transition to the Light Side, but in the time of his hesitation, other First Order ships shoot down the Resistance Fleet, including Leia, giving us a noble, tragic death to a loved original trilogy character (R.I.P. Carrie Fisher ❤️). This act of Kylo Ren hesitating causes Snoke to become furious with him and find him weak. Rey becomes very confused with who to trust so she decides to go to Kylo Ren for help, him being the best person to talk to. Kylo Ren decides to take her in and shows her to Snoke. At this time, Snoke starts to torture Rey with some Dark Side messed up force which causes Ren to rebel and give off a big reveal (bigger than “I am your father” as stated by director) and the two fight Snoke together. Obviously with there being another entry in the series, Kylo Ren (now becoming Ben Solo once again) return to the Resistance base together as a team. In the meantime during all of this Finn and Friends break into First Order territory leading to him facing Captain Phasma in that dope looking fight scene. Honestly, this may be the best Star Wars movie in the saga, really excited for it.",0

Spartan 324,"I know we are months away....but here is my thoughts brought on by all the trailers.  We have seen so much emotion come to the surface.  The way Force Awaken ending, the emotion brought out of Ren by killing his father.  the reaction we got from looking at Luke and Rey&#39;s face at the end.  Now with the trailers how serious, frightening, somber yet firm tones we get from voices.  The Grey Jedi are coming back, Luke is going back to those teachings, where emotion is important and needed in a Jedi.  He is beginning to understand that control over those emotions is what is needed, not for them to be cast aside.  You can see Luke is afraid, fear is present in his voice yet it is not shaking.  Thus he is learning or learned control over his emotions.  Rey is searching for a teacher(s) for a path to walk in this world.  I think Ren is too,  I do not believe he is fully devoted to the Snoke or the First Order.  I forsee Ren and Rey becoming the first true Grey Jedi to return to this Galaxy, maybe not in this movie but I think it is coming",1

Lawrence Samuel Grefiel,This sucks the trailer looks like not convincing to watch compared with other trailer I&#39;m not A Star Wars haters but the franchise is considered as fatigue because let&#39;s consider the fact that disney was making Star Wars every year looks like they run out of ideas. As you can in this Star Wars trailer they tease a new character or something that will convince but it&#39;s not interesting to know. will of course I should wait maybe in the next trailer. But overall this movie looks cool and I hope in the next trailer they will show a interesting part on a trailer that will convince me. this movie franchise was not sucked but for now I would say the trailer looks awful.,0

Rey. He treated Kylo to find Rey in the same manner Palpatine used Vader to tempt Luke.<br><br>•In the midst of internal confliction and convictions, Kylo sets out to kill leia.<br><br>•Eventually, rey and kylo join forces... They are both internally conflicted individuals.<br><br>•They will both probably end up as a &quot;gray&quot; jedi- which is basically mutual, like Luke.<br><br>•Finn and Poe, on the other hands, are the ones who will soon take the reigns as resistence leaders following Leia&#39;s death. Finn, after being promoted, takes on his former leader- Captain Phasma herself.",1

We hear Ren talk about “letting the past go”; does the past mean his mother and letting it go mean killing her? We also see him in his own star fighter and targeting what seems to be a capital ship, most likely of the Resistance, and Leia is also aboard a ship, most likely on the bridge We also see Ren and Leia’s faces; they both look solemn and emotional, could this be the connection they experience using the force? Either way it’s intriguing, and a sad ending to a beloved character. (RIP Carrie❤️)",0

LEOBROS,"I think it is simple. Kylo Ren is conflicted. If he dies, another Knight of Ren/Pratorian Guard will take his place. At the beginning he stands alone, he talks about being your true self is destroying your past, and he looks like he is emotionally unstable. These are the attributes of a character that has too many ways to make a sacrifice. He will not make it out of this one alive.a first order stormtrooper has a better chance of surviving than Kylo. Enjoy him while he lasts. He truly is a great character. But they are making the smart move to end him now before the Vader comparisons get blown out of proportion. Make no mistake though, he will kill someone else in this movie before he goes.....",2

Chris P Bacon,"betting that rey joins kylo but not as an ally. she goes with him to meet snoke and to try and kill him, dispite luke&#39;s warning prompting him to try and save her which results in his death. what would be cool is luke&#39;s death acting as a catalyst for kylo to either turn good guy and rey to be bad or they both be bad or one kills the other/replaces the other... eitherway I hope fin becomes the hero by the end and rey either dies (unlikely) or becomes the villain or something",0

noahtimesdos,"Well this certainly is an interesting trailer, and it implies quite a lot. Kylo and Rey might have the same kind of extreme power taken from the lore and what Luke said about being afraid of that kind of energy. It creates a very interesting dilemma because these two very strong and evenly matched characters are now making their way to the opposite sides they seem to be on. Kylo&#39;s emotions are holding him back and pushing him towards the light, while Rey&#39;s quest to become stronger and learn her place in the universe appears to be pushing her towards help from the dark. <br><br>So far it&#39;s creating a lot of very intriguing dynamics between these characters that we know not a lot about, but enough to understand their motivations. And here I thought it was going to be one sided with Finn and Rey fighting evil. Good to see the new guys are taking some complex angles and trying more diverse means of storytelling, unlike the prequels. But good ideas are just that, good ideas. It&#39;s easy for something to look good on paper, execution is the important part. So now I guess we wait to see the execution.",0

Jotham Heystee,"What does Luke mean he has only seen that much raw strength once? If he is talking about himself, that makes sense. If he is talking about Kylo Ren, I might as well just leave this movie series right now. From the trailer alone you can definitely tell Leia dies, Kylo and Rey team up (one of them turns, but I have no idea which one), and Luke looks like he is left in the dust just talking on about what is bound to happen, with little action. Rey cannot be stronger than Luke was during his prime because that would break the actual Canon that is still consider such, unless they get rid of that too. I like this video because the trailer looks awesome, but the movie itself? Most likely just downgraded from this intensity in the trailer. Let&#39;s not be ever so ignorant and get hyped too much now, the movie could be entirely different. I felt more of a sickness when watching this, instead of the majority here getting excited..",0

My quick thoughts on Force Awakens is that I think its absolutely great with only minor flaws, and Rogue One I think is alright but completely enjoyable. Lets just hope this new director, who by the way is a fantastic director (Looper, Breaking Bad), can make the best new Star Wars film we&#39;ve seen yet!",0

Also, despite having many of his apprentices ( including his nephew Jason Solo) fall to the Darkside, Legends Luke never let the guilt and regret consume him in the way I feel it has for Canon Luke.",0

rugbytroller,My theory is that when snoke is a ancient sith that was hurt in battle or something and has been hiding in the unknown region hence why palpatine went looking but when you hear snoke speaking first he’s actually talking about Rey and saying that she was more powerful than kylo and that he needs to absorb Force energy to bring him self back to full power but as she so strong she blocks him out like she did with kylo in ep 7 and kylo will kill leia but snoke will use Rey as bait to capture Luke and absorb his force and snoke will be so powerful he won’t need kylo and will try and kill him and Rey but they escape and the end scene is actually kylo realising he was used and that only if kylo and Rey work together will they be able to kill snoke,1

Liam Barclay,"Snoke is an ancient sith from the times of the old Republic who was locked away by the ancient jedi in the unknown regions of space.  Snoke was so powerful in the dark side of the force that he had to absorb the force energy of jedi to maintain his physical self.  Snoke made up the prophecy so that the jedi would need a reason to keep recruiting new jedi which ultimately, acted as fuel for him.  We can see Rey fulfilling &quot;her destiny&quot; to Snoke during this tralier when he says &quot;fulfill your destiny&quot;.  From a marketing standpoint this is genius because is means Disney will be able to make a new trilogy about snoke and the ancient jedi after this trilogy is finished.",37

But Bastilla got captured near the end of the game and turned to the Dark Side so we ended up with Revan on the light side against Bastilla on the Dark Side. Kylo does look a lot like a Revan and Rey like Bastilla (and she will even more if she gets a double bladed lightsaber). We might end up with having Rey pulling Kylo to the light, Snoke turning Rey to the Dark Side and having Light Side Kylo vs Dark Side Rey.",0

Rey in her shot is talking to someone but we don’t know completely who, but she is wearing her old robes from episode 7 and the background is different, and her voice sounds like she’s in a dream or vision or flashback because of the echo of her voice. And Kylo Ren in his shot has no open wound on his face, but there is a scar, but in the shots in the trailer he has an open wound and the background is different as well. And I’m checking the other teasers for more evidence but please tell me if I missed out on something or if something doesn’t make sense.",1

Sean C,"So in the trailer it&#39;s implied that Snoke is addressing Rey, him mentioning raw power when he found the person he&#39;s talking to and Rey saying she pretty much has power locked away. Rey being originally in the hands of Snoke makes sense and can explain why she was put placed on Jakku, kidnapping her and hiding her from Snoke just as how Luke was hidden from Palpatine. In retaliation, Snoke brings Kylo to the Dark Side and probably attacks the Jedi Temple as revenge as well. Now with Kylo hesitant to kill Han, he seems even more so when confronted with the option to blow Leia&#39;s command ship. So perhaps at the end of the trailer, we see Kylo reaching out his hand to embrace Leia while Rey finally asks to be trained by Snoke after Luke&#39;s apparent refusal because of the same power he witnessed before.",0

He&#39;s been too afraid to face his problems, and now, his cowardice is going to send another budding Jedi to the Dark Side. Thankfully, it doesn&#39;t look as though Snoke follows the laws of the Sith, which means Kylo Ren is going to have a partner in crime.",0

Hackin Tosh,"Everything about this looks awful. Cinematography looks like a fan film, and everyone seems like a cartoon villain or hero. Any kind of logic is gone. Luke is the son of the messiah in Star Wars and now Ren and Rey are stronger than Anakin and Luke whom Lucas said had the potential of Anakin? Star Wars is dead. Kathleen Kennedy killed it. Han is now a loser who left his family and loved ones in their greatest time of need and Luke did the same and is now also a weakling. This is just man hating, feminist fan fiction. Thanks 2017 and Disney and feminism. It wasn&#39;t enough for Disney to ruin ESPN and Marvel comics. They also had to ruin Star Wars.",0

Adam Driver looks a little corny at times in this trailer tho in my opinion, but I understand how he adds to the the characters popularity and the development of new Star War&#39;s fans. Mark Hamill also has some awkward moments. Yet, his presence alone adds to the validity of the film and it&#39;s attempt to tie together a consistent timeline, which is satisfying to the first generation Star Wars fan. RIP Carrie Fisher she looked sick to me in the trailer....sad. Yet Daisy, and John add to the refreshing diversity that these new films bring to the forefront.",6

I think we may see Luke fight, maybe in a flashback since he was laying down in the rain, which I assume is after Kylo Ren betrays him. Could be wrong.<br>4. Finn&#39;s alive.<br>5. Rey questioning where she fits into all this is interesting because she has to make the choice between the Dark and Light, and brings a very intriguing dynamic and storyline.",0

mike gurgle,"Rey(name unknown right now) + Kylo/Ben vs snoke in Ep9.  Doubt Luke will die.  Leah will not die either, but if Luke does then this is not even close to Canon at all.  Luke is supposed to be the most powerful force user right now.  Kylo doesn&#39;t just get trained a little then defeat a Master like Luke.  It&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be probable at all.  Also, if Luke does have some Dark Side in him, OK that&#39;s understandable.  He&#39;s got no one to train him.  If he found some old books that show grey Jedi and what they practiced, then he will in fact use both Light and Dark side powers.",0

Until disney took star wars and broke the prophecy with Snoke and Kylo. So thanks disney. The prophecy is over.

I Don't Care,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Star Wars. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the heroe&#39;s journey most of the scenes will go over a typical viewer&#39;s head. There&#39;s also Rey&#39;s optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation - her personal philosophy draws heavily from Shel Silverstein&#39;s literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realize that they&#39;re not just epic- they say something deep about THE FORCE. As a consequence people who dislike Star Wars truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#39;t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rey&#39;s prophetic catchphrase &quot;I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this,&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to Lucas&#39; earlier films from the original trilogy. I&#39;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as JJ Abrams&#39; genius unfolds itself on their movie screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a slave Leia tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It&#39;s for the ladies&#39; eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they&#39;re within 5 midichlorian levels of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0

Bryce Spencer,"After watching this trailer, I am certain of a few things that will probably happen:<br>1. Snoke is speaking about Rey&#39;s power in the Force and will tempt her to join the dark side.<br>2. Luke will be afraid to train Rey since he will reveal what happened with the Knights of Ren and Kylo Ren.<br>3. Rey and Kylo Ren join forces.<br>Other than that, I have no idea what is going to happen.",1

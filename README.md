Sentiment Analysis on Text Data
This project explores sentiment analysis techniques on two diverse datasets: 
1) Twitter data from Kaggle with labeled sentiments for evaluation.
2) YouTube comments on the controversial "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" trailer.

Various text preprocessing methods like lemmatization, stemming, tokenization, NER, spell checking, bigram analysis, and contradiction fixing are employed to enhance robustness. 

The repository includes analyses, visualizations, a curated slang dictionary (with some profanity), and a notebook demonstrating the complete workflow. Runtime is approximately 6-7 hours.
